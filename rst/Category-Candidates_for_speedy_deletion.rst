{{See alsoCategory:Proposed deletion}} This category is made to help
administrators to find pages someone else has tagged for deletion.

The template {{tl|delete}} automatically inserts this category:
''Category:Candidates for speedy deletion''. Please only add pages whose
content is obviously wrong, irrelevant or spam. If this is not the case
please nominate it for deletion at [[Wiki Issues]] so we can discuss
about and vote on the deletion.
