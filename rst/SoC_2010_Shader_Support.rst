=Shader support for video post-processing=

==Abstract== A lot of video post-processing such as RGB-YUV conversion
can be accelerated by using the GPU. This can either be achieved through
a fragment shader, where it is the last step before a pixel is displayed
on the screen, or it can be done with DirectCompute/CUDA/OpenCL. The
method will vary depending on the task and intent. I will implement
support for shaders by using the DirectX and OpenGL API and write a few
shaders such as RGB-YUV conversion.

==Information== I go to UCSD, and my last final is on June 9th, so I
will only be able to work part-time until then.
