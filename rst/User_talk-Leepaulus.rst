VLC locks up when trying to open a folder (MOVIE) stored on my hard
drive. This situation began when VLC downloaded an update (2.1.5). I
uninstalled VLC and then downloaded fresh from the videoLAN website.
Same problem. In the upper left corner "vlc media player" flashes on and
off in a rapid stuttering manner several seconds until the program locks
up. :Please refer to [//forum.videolan.org/ the support forum] for
