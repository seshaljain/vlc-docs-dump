A FourCC – also spelled FOURCC or fourcc – is a 4-byte identifier which specifies the format of a video stream.

Every `codec <codec>`__ has its own unique FourCC. Commonly, each byte corresponds to a printable character in the `ASCII character set <wikipedia:ASCII>`__, making the sequence human-readable.

This is very useful for determining whether can decode a video stream. For audio streams, a `TwoCC <https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/TwoCC>`__ is used.
