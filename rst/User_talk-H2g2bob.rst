I see that you've been working on the main page. Would you like to have access to the real main page in order to change it instead of a copy ? `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 21:44, 14 January 2006 (CET)

   I think the page is pretty much finished (so if you only want to copy it that's fine), but it would be quite useful to have access to it in case I need to change anything --`H2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 21:53, 14 January 2006 (CET)

      I installed the wikimedia SpamBlacklist filter so it should be ok to unprotect the Main Page. You can now edit it `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 22:10, 14 January 2006 (CET)

      Brilliant: thank you. Just copied it over now --`H2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 22:20, 14 January 2006 (CET)

Is there any way to become an admin (sysop) for this site - it would be nice to be able to change pages like `Help:Contents <Help:Contents>`__ to have something on them. --`H2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 19:06, 16 January 2006 (CET)

   there you go :) Thanks for the help btw. `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 23:41, 16 January 2006 (CET)

I started a bit of cleanup of the Main Page, and would like to clean a bit more all the wiki. What do you think of it ? `J-b <User:J-b>`__ 02:28, 15 December 2006 (CET)

   That's pretty good - it's a bit more ordered now, so much better for finding where you want to go. I shifted the "help the project" bit up to be directly under the "support/get help", as it was quite a bit below on my screen. It certainly gets the h2g2bob `barnstar <wikipedia:WP:BARN>`__ of approval! --`h2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 06:40, 15 December 2006 (CET)

      Thanks, I was not able to do that correctly, I was not really aware of the wiki syntax. I am discovering it. So now, the following tasks are to clean the rest of the wiki. I think a Portal:Developers would be a good idea, don't you think ? What about a greater use of categories. And report the Wikipedia description of VLC here ? `J-b <User:J-b>`__ 11:35, 15 December 2006 (CET)

         Wouldn't Portal:Developers just be `Developers Corner <Developers_Corner>`__ :-) Categories is a must: I think it would be easiest to add them through templates, eg a template for muxers like `ASF <ASF>`__ and `AVI <AVI>`__ saying what their name is when you use them in the command line. --`h2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 02:01, 16 December 2006 (CET)

            Ok. You are right. I'll try to understand templates `J-b <User:J-b>`__ 19:13, 16 December 2006 (CET)
            I finished the Developers corner. And I try to reduce the number of orphan page. It seems that your talk page is becoming a redesignWiki Page. good night `J-b <User:J-b>`__ 03:57, 17 December 2006 (CET)

   I added a `Template:mux <Template:mux>`__ for `container <container>`__ formats (eg: `ogg <ogg>`__, `mkv <mkv>`__). I was thinking that perhaps a similar thing would work for video / audio codecs, but have them all different colours or something. Any views on whether this is a good thing, or what else could be done to it? --`h2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 03:37, 16 December 2006 (CET)

      I think it is a good thing. But would it be used ? `J-b <User:J-b>`__ 19:13, 16 December 2006 (CET)

   I changed the left menu. Comments ? A lot of more work to do !\ `J-b <User:J-b>`__ 19:13, 16 December 2006 (CET)

      I think that's better too - I like the way it's split, it makes sense. --`h2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 23:17, 16 December 2006 (CET)

Good work

VideoLAN team map
-----------------

Hi. I've added a VideoLAN team map on http://www.videolan.org/team/. I'd be glad to add you to the map if you want to. Have a look at http://www.videolan.org/team/team.xml to see what data is required (latitude and longitude can be found on http://maps.google.com, the ll=, value in the URL). Regards `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 16:27, 28 March 2007 (CEST)

   Ta, I will --`h2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 17:53, 24 April 2007 (CEST)

You still here?
