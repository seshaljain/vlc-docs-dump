**Lossless** is a way of `compressing <compress>`__ data which is fully reversible, i.e., does not "throw away" data. A losslessly compressed file can be used to create an exact copy of the source file.

**Lossy** is the opposite of lossless. A certain amount of data is discarded; how much is usually dependent upon a quality or `bit rate <bit_rate>`__ setting of the codec. This makes the file (or stream) much smaller that lossless compression, but reduces the quality. It is impossible to `transcode <transcode>`__ from one lossy format to another without further degrading quality.
