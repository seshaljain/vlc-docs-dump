== Audio Normalisation<br> ==

The following might help if you are having troubles adjusting the volume
in movies; music, explosions, gunshots, etc. being too loud or
conversations being too quiet.

Navigate to '''Tools &gt; Preferences'''.

Select '''Audio'''. Check the '''Normalize volume to:''' box and set the
value to 1.6

Now switch to Advanced view by selecting '''All''' in the ''Show
Settings'' box at the bottom left.

Expand '''Audio''' and highlight '''Filters'''. Check the '''Volume
Normalizer''' box. You should see ''normvol'' added to the text box at
the bottom.

Expand '''Filters''' and highlight '''Volume Normalizer'''. Set
'''Number of audio buffers''' to ''10'' and '''Maximal volume level'''
to ''1.6''.

Hit the '''Save''' button at the bottom.

Restart VLC, as settings are not applied until restart.
