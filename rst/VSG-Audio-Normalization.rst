Audio Normalisation
-------------------

The following might help if you are having troubles adjusting the volume in movies; music, explosions, gunshots, etc. being too loud or conversations being too quiet.

Navigate to **Tools > Preferences**.

Select **Audio**. Check the **Normalize volume to:** box and set the value to 1.6

Now switch to Advanced view by selecting **All** in the *Show Settings* box at the bottom left.

Expand **Audio** and highlight **Filters**. Check the **Volume Normalizer** box. You should see *normvol* added to the text box at the bottom.

Expand **Filters** and highlight **Volume Normalizer**. Set **Number of audio buffers** to *10* and **Maximal volume level** to *1.6*.

Hit the **Save** button at the bottom.

Restart VLC, as settings are not applied until restart.
