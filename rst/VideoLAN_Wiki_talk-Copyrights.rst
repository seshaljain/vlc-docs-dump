What *is* the copyright on the stuff here? Is it GPL, GFDL, Creative Commons...? --`h2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 14:50, 20 November 2006 (CET)

   The new documentation section clearly states that all pages in the Documentation namespace ( **http://wiki.videolan.org/index.php/Documentation:.\*** ) are licensed under the GPL. This is mainly due to the fact that the old documentation which i moved to the wiki was already licensed under the GPL. All other wiki pages don't have clear licensing info that i know of. `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 19:05, 20 November 2006 (CET)
