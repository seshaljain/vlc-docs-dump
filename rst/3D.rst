{{Howto|to use VLC to watch 3D video}}

==3D Display Technologies==

Generally there are three widely use 3D display technologies, all based
on the principles of stereoscopic projection:

-  [[wikipedia:Anaglyph image|Anaglyph]] - red/green or red/blue images
   with glasses filtering out one colour or the other
-  Polarisation - technique used in cinemas, with two images projected
   with different polarisations, a silvered screen and polarised glasses
   <br> Also TV sets are capable of producing polarized light; they use
   interlaced displays for the left and right pictures, the even lines
   and the odd lines differently polarized (which effectively halves the
   vertical resolution in 3D mode)
-  [[wikipedia:Liquid crystal shutter glasses|Shutter Glasses]] -
   technique used by the new 3D televisions, where each alternating
   frame represent the left or right views.

==How to view 3D videos in VLC== VLC since 2.1.0 has built-in support
for viewing '''3D side-by-side (SBS)''' videos using '''anaglyph'''
technology.

See [[Documentation:Modules/anaglyph]].
