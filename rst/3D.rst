3D Display Technologies
-----------------------

Generally there are three widely use 3D display technologies, all based on the principles of stereoscopic projection:

-  `Anaglyph <wikipedia:Anaglyph_image>`__ - red/green or red/blue images with glasses filtering out one colour or the other
-  Polarisation - technique used in cinemas, with two images projected with different polarisations, a silvered screen and polarised glasses
   Also TV sets are capable of producing polarized light; they use interlaced displays for the left and right pictures, the even lines and the odd lines differently polarized (which effectively halves the vertical resolution in 3D mode)
-  `Shutter Glasses <wikipedia:Liquid_crystal_shutter_glasses>`__ - technique used by the new 3D televisions, where each alternating frame represent the left or right views.

How to view 3D videos in VLC
----------------------------

VLC since 2.1.0 has built-in support for viewing **3D side-by-side (SBS)** videos using **anaglyph** technology.

See `Documentation:Modules/anaglyph <Documentation:Modules/anaglyph>`__.
