Those rules are mostly for x264 and VLC.

   Those rules are quite flexible for any situation.

= Rules = ''We don't like rules.''

''We like freedom and having fun with software programming.''

However, we have no choice, seeing past experiences and issues. :'(

== Summer Generalities == If you are a student, we expect that: \* You
don't have a full-time job during your summer if you are doing SoC at
the same time, \* You are of good will to work within VideoLAN team.

If you are a mentor, we expect that: \* You are willing to work with one
student and answers his questions.

== Selection ==

To be selected, students should: \* Select an idea, \* Post a proposal
on Google website, \* Show on IRC, \* Join the mailing lists (x264-devel
or vlc-devel, according to your project), \* Say hello to the potential
mentor and admin.

-  Learn about the code you should modify (where in the source, what is
   the idea...),
-  Be able to compile a VLC or x264 for your platform and learn how to
   use [[Git]].
-  Show the team that you compiled VLC and x264, by probably provide a
   small patch and a build. You can send the patch to an admin or to
   vlc-devel@ or x264-devel@
-  Do one of the slection task (can be done after proposing the
   proposal)
-  Complete the Google admission and give a planning idea.

=== VLC selection tasks (before April 15)=== \* Examples of small
patches: \*\* QtCoverFlow integration (mandatory for any Qt related
project), \*\* ASX playlists improvements (see
[http://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/20 ticket 20]
[http://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/2178 ticket 2178] and the code
there) (easy) \*\* <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">RAM
playlists support (easy),</span> \*\* <span style="text-decoration:
line-through;">WPL and ZPL playlists support (easy too),</span> \*\*
Close a VLC bug on trac, \*\* Add RMI (RIFF MIDI) support to the SMF
demux, \*\* libsox based module, \*\* port a demuxer from mplayer or
ffmpeg, \*\* Extend the DBus control to activate a video filter on the
fly on an already playing video, \*\* Add new audio effects like chorus,
reverb or phasing, \*\* Fix warnings, \*\* Add some simple feature that
sounds nice to you.

== During the summer ==

=== Student expectations === \* Student should explain his planning to
his mentor and to an admin (not everyone has the same vacations) \*
Student should report with a small mail once a week to both mentor and
admin during the time agreed (failure to do that will fail the
application) \* Student should commit on his personal ''git branch''
once a week, except the first week of your schedule (or more if your
project is complex). '''Explaining why you can't work one week is fine.
Disappearing without notice is not.''' \* Update wiki status page.

=== Student rights === \* Ask questions and stupid questions to anyone
\* Bother the mentor with questions \* Ask the admin for another mentor
if the mentor doesn't answer or doesn't fit.

Students will be considered as '''full-right''' developers.

=== Mentor expectations === \* Mentor should report to admins any
problems as soon as noticed, \* Mentor should tell admins if they can't
make it in order to have another mentor for the student.

=== Mentor rights === \* Fail a student :D

= Advice =

== To get selected ==

-  Be nice.
-  Show us basic skills with checking out and compiling the VLC code
   base.
-  Show us that you understand the VLC architecture. Code samples are
   good.
-  Come on IRC. Hang out, talk to us.

== During the SoC == '''''COMMIT EARLY, COMMIT OFTEN'''''

-  Please do check that your commits compile. This makes it much easier
   to find problems later on, as searching for one problem doesn't
   stumble into broken commits that relate to something else entirely.
-  Ask questions. Don't sit on problems until the GSoC is over.
-  Don't be afraid to start researching your question yourself then
   check whether you are on the right track with your mentor. He (or
   others on the mailinglist or in the irc channel) will be happier to
   answer you if you can show you have done the groundwork. It tends to
   make explanations shorter and more meaningful, too.
-  Finishing the GSoC project in time is pretty cool too. It's your
   show! Make it something nice.
