{{Lowercase}} {{websitehttps://www.apple.com/itunes/}}

'''iTunes''' is a [[media player]] created by Apple for [[macOS]] and
[[Windows]] (2000 and later). iTunes has the ability to connect with an
[[iPod]].

iTunes also connects to [https://www.apple.com/retail Apple Store]. Like
almost all music bought online, this music is protected by [[DRM]] (in
this case [[FairPlay]]).

iTunes can also share music over a local network using the
[[wikipedia:Bonjour (protocol)|Bonjour protocol]].

==Compatibility== VLC supports service discovery with Bonjour through
its [[Documentation:Modules/bonjour|bonjour]] module and supports DAAP
(iTunes shares).
