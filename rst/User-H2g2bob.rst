{{wikipedia|User:h2g2bob}} Hello, I'm '''h2g2bob'''. I use VLC quite a
bit, and am mad enough to have used some of it's wackier features.
However, I'm not a developer and VLC can do lots of things I don't know
about.

If you're stuck, it's best to check out the [[Common Problems]] page, or
post in the [[Forum]].
