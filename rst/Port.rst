{{Wikipedia|Port (computer networking)}}

A port is a number used to identify incoming and outgoing computer
traffic. Programs may look to communicate over a particular port, e.g.
for streaming or network shares.

Ports rarely need to be specified unless asked for on the
[[command-line]] or you are connecting over a network share.
