I am confused as to how to get VLC to load the gme plugin. I've tried
looking at the help (-h) and long help (-H) to try and figure out how to
load gme. Gme is not in my list of plugins available (-l) but I cannot
find how to load it in.

Please help us find out how to load gme in, and if it's small perhaps
have it as one of the default codecs within VLC?

A few people are having trouble, here's a forum message on the topic as
well [http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=33305
