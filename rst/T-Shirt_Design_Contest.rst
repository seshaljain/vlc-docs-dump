==The Competition==

''Sorry, the VideoLAN T-Shirt Design Contest is now over.''

The T-Shirt is supposed to show support to the VideoLAN project. It
would be nice if people seeing the T-Shirt could guess that its about
some video player/server related project (and maybe even put the
videolan.org url somewhere).

For price reasons, the number of colors on the T-shirt will likely be
limited to 3. (that makes it about 7 euros production cost per T-Shirt
if we order 100)

The VideoLAN graphics you might want to use are :
