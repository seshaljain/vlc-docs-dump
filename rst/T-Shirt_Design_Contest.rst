The Competition
---------------

*Sorry, the VideoLAN T-Shirt Design Contest is now over.*

The T-Shirt is supposed to show support to the VideoLAN project. It would be nice if people seeing the T-Shirt could guess that its about some video player/server related project (and maybe even put the videolan.org url somewhere).

For price reasons, the number of colors on the T-shirt will likely be limited to 3. (that makes it about 7 euros production cost per T-Shirt if we order 100)

The VideoLAN graphics you might want to use are :

| The VLC cone :

| The VideoLAN logo :
