Link Styling
------------

Hi everyone. I made it so that all links to videolan.org have a little picture by them. Is that okay? `Let me know. <User_talk:The_thing>`__ To make the image not appear, you just dont type the "www." `The thing <User:The_thing>`__ :sup:`(`\ `Talk <User_talk:The_thing>`__\ :sup:`â€¢`\ `Contribs <Special:Contributions/The_thing>`__\ :sup:`)` 22:23, 13 July 2008 (CEST)

Pre text wrapping
-----------------

| Hi all, I'm about to make a change for everyone here. Text in ``<pre>...</pre>`` tags will now soft-wrap.
| Here's a line from `Documentation:Streaming HowTo/Advanced Streaming Using the Command Line <Documentation:Streaming_HowTo/Advanced_Streaming_Using_the_Command_Line>`__ that shows you what I mean.
| Before (no wrapping):

::

   % vlc input_stream --sout "#module1{option1=parameter1{parameter-option1},option2=parameter2}:module2{option1=...,option2=...}:..."

After (wrapping):

::

   % vlc input_stream --sout "#module1{option1=parameter1{parameter-option1},option2=parameter2}:module2{option1=...,option2=...}:..."

I prefer this because I can read without having to scroll. If you feel differently `tell me <User_talk:DoesItReallyMatter>`__ and I'll revert the change (or you can do it yourself).
