== VLC just bounces in the Dock and quits or just shows a "VLC" menu and
nothing else. ==

<br>The issue is common in Mac OS&nbsp;X.

Please check, whether you're using a VLC release, which is capable to
run on your version of Mac OS X.

<br>

If it fits, run the "Remove Preferences" script provided on VLC's
disk-image or delete both a folder called "VLC" and a file called
org.videolan.vlc.plist in ~/Library/Preferences (your personal
preferences folder).<br>
