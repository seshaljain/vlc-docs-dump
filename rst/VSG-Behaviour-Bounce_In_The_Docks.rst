VLC just bounces in the Dock and quits or just shows a "VLC" menu and nothing else.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| 
| The issue is common in Mac OS X.

Please check, whether you're using a VLC release, which is capable to run on your version of Mac OS X.

| 
| If it fits, run the "Remove Preferences" script provided on VLC's disk-image or delete both a folder called "VLC" and a file called org.videolan.vlc.plist in ~/Library/Preferences (your personal preferences folder).
