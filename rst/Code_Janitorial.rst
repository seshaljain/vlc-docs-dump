Here is some samples janitorial task you can pick up:

General appearance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keeping the source uniformly less than 78 characters wide so it and patches both fit nicely on a 80 column screen is good general practice but it doesn't always happen. Thus an opportunity to reformat clearly overlong lines.

Function header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The function header commentary isn't uniformed across files. We suggest you to try to tidy this.

| ``/**************************************************************************  |``
| `` * Get the Media descriptor associated with the instance                  *  | <- function header commentary``
| `` **************************************************************************/ |``
| ``libvlc_media_descriptor_t *``
| ``libvlc_media_instance_get_media_descriptor(``
| ``                           libvlc_media_instance_t *p_mi,``
| ``                           libvlc_exception_t *p_e )``
| ``{``
| ``  ...``
| ``}``

Janitorial commits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please, please do not mix cosmetic (reformatting and so on) changes with changes that alter code behaviour in the same commit. Put them in a separate commit marked with ``Cosmetic: (description here)``. Make sure the changes compile before you commit anyway.

Doxygen
~~~~~~~

You can document some parts of VLC's code that aren't correctly documented using Doxygen. Ask on IRC for help.

Warning fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some warnings are easy to fix, don't hesitate to provide a fix.
