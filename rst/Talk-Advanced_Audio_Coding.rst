If we're just going to be using Wikipedia content, how about just pushing users directly to the Wikipedia page, or maybe have the pages use a template that says "More information on this subject is available from Wikipedia, click on `%name% <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%name%>`__ to continue to Wikipedia."? --`tonsofpcs <User:Tonsofpcs>`__ 23:57, 16 January 2006 (CET)

      It's a fair point - I'll have a stab of changing this. I also added the {{{wikipedia}}} template not long ago, so feel free to use that. --`H2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 00:05, 17 January 2006 (CET)

      i agree. This wiki ought to have VideoLAN / VLC / VLS /... specific pages only. -- `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 00:08, 17 January 2006 (CET)
