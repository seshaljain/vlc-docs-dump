If we're just going to be using Wikipedia content, how about just
pushing users directly to the Wikipedia page, or maybe have the pages
use a template that says "More information on this subject is available
from Wikipedia, click on
[`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%name% <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%name%>`__
%name%] to continue to Wikipedia."? --[[User:Tonsofpcs|tonsofpcs]]

:: It's a fair point - I'll have a stab of changing this. I also added
the <nowiki>{{{wikipedia}}}</nowiki> template not long ago, so feel free
to use that. --[[User:H2g2bob|H2g2bob]] 00:05, 17 January 2006 (CET)

::: i agree. This wiki ought to have VideoLAN / VLC / VLS /... specific
pages only. -- [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 00:08, 17 January 2006 (CET)
