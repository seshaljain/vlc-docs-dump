{{Moduletype=Video filteros=Cross platform|first_version=2.1.0}}

VLC, since version 2.1.0, is capable of playing 3D side-by-side (SBS)
videos using anaglyph technology, viewable with typical paper red-cyan
3D glasses.

To enable this filter, go to '''Tools → Effects and Filters → Video
Filters → Advanced''' and check off '''Anaglyph 3D'''.

The colour scheme of the glasses can be changed by going to '''Tools →
Preferences (All) → Video → Filters → Anaglyph''' and changing the combo
box labelled '''Color scheme''' on the right. Save and restart VLC for
settings to take effect.
