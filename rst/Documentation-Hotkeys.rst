Most of VLC functions are accessible using hotkeys.
{{RightMenu|Documentation TOC}}

The list of the available hotkeys and their functions can be retrieved
and altered in the ''Preferences'' panel of the player. In the Windows
and Linux interface, ''Preferences'' are available in the "Tools" tab as
the "Preferences" menu item. In the MacOS X interface, open the "VLC"
menu, and select "Preferences". Select the "Hot keys" panel in the
dialog.

<br> As of version 0.9, a list of hotkeys are presented in a drop-down
window. To change one, double-click its name to select it. Then, press
the new key that will trigger the specified action. Modifier keys (such
as Control/Command and Alt) may also be used. In the 1.x version you can
also filter hotkeys with a search filter.

In earlier versions, several boxes gave the list of modifiers for the
hotkey. To trigger an action using a hotkey, you need to press
simultaneously the keys corresponding to the different selected
modifiers as well as the key set in the dropdown.

To change the binding of a hotkey, select or deselect boxes
corresponding to the different modifiers, and change the key by using
the drop-down menu. Select the ''Save'' button to apply the changes.
