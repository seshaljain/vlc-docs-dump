HandBrake is a cross-platform graphical [[transcoding]] tool that
supports many formats. It is released under GPLv2.

It is not a [[VideoLAN project]] but it shares several [[libraries]]
with {{VLC}}, including [[FFmpeg]], [[x264]] and [[x265]]. It actively
uses the VideoLAN libraries [[libdvdnav]] and [[libdvdread]], and
formerly used [[libdvdcss]] to decrypt [[DVD]]s until version 0.9.2.
