General presentation
--------------------

Hello!

My name is **Mathieu DUCAMP**. I'm a student of ISTIA at University of Angers in France (`ISTIA <http://www.istia.univ-angers.fr/>`__).

I work on a project for the company Actech called Recording. I work with the members of this site like `Thannoy <http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Thannoy>`__, `Remiii <http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Remiii>`__ and an other student of my school `aurel_istia <http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Aurel_istia>`__.

For my project, I begin in the VLC development, and I risk to have some questions and I hope you help me. Thank you.

You can see my advancement in my project `here <http://shiva.istia.univ-angers.fr/~adroch/index.php?page=suiviPj>`__ ,but it is in French (sorry!).

See you!
