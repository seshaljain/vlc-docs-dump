Installing VLC under Redhat/Fedora
----------------------------------

Set up Yum Repositories such as Livna http://rpm.livna.org etc.After you have followed the instructions there.

``[root@x32.fedora.prudhvi.in]# yum install vlc``

will install VLC Media Player.

If you have any issues inputting from an external device to the "line-in" under Redhat, be sure to check the /etc/.aumixrc file. By default, it doesn't contain an entry for recording from the line-in device. Add one and reload the mixer settings (the command can be found in /etc/modules.conf) and you're good to go.
