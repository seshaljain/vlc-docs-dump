== '''VLC 0.8.1 fails to work on some versions of Mac OS''' ==

If you are a Mac user and can't install VLC 0.8.1 it is probably because
your operating system is OS X 10.1.5, Mac OS 9, or lower than this.

VLC is not supported for these versions of the operating system and will
never be.

If you have Mac OS X 10.1.5 or lower all you can do is update your
system to Mac OS X 10.2 or newer which is faster than 10.1.5. When this
is done you should be able to install VLC properly without any trouble.
