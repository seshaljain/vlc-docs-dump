= Before Leaving =

You must have a valid passport '''and''' an onward/return ticket for
tourist/business "visa free" stays.

Your passport must be valid for the entire time you are staying in Japan
which is a max of 90 days.

If you land or depart from HND, it's easier/better.

Be prepared '''in case or serious shit''': Japan can be wonderful, but
as you may know is also one of the top countries hit by Earthquakes
(daily) but also Typhoons and Tsunamis. Plan your flight(s) with
sufficient margin in case of Typhoon (which really means shutdown), but
also your train might be delayed after a local earthquake because they
need to stop, then lower their speed. You might want to keep an Eye on
http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/en/menu.html for that purpose. A dedicated app
for foreigners is also available
https://www.jnto.go.jp/safety-tips/eng/app.html

Be sure to let know your hotel & plans to someone outside of Japan. For
example, French People can use
[https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fildariane/dyn/public/login.html
Ariane]

Know your nearby English-speaking hospital:
https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html and your consulate.

Also save Japan Helpline Number's providing 24/24 7/7 English support :
0120-461-997

Be prepared to pay most of your expenses by '''cash'''. Do not expect
your VISA card to work in every shop and every ATM (see below). VISA
Japan is not VISA international but use the same logo... Note that your
embassy is not a travel agency: you are unlikely to receive any help
there if you run out of cash.

Japan uses US power plugs and voltage. 110V and 50Hz or ... 60Hz
(annoying if you plan to bring in your CRT TV).

Unless you have a ''OnePlus'' or other "Global" model, your Phone might
'''not''' even work, depending on frequencies and network operator
(SIM). Check https://willmyphonework.net/

Your data plan is unlikely to work. 4G data in Japan is really expensive
compared to Europe. You might want to buy a SIM data plan outside of
Japan (see below).

Don't be stupid to bring illegal stuff in:
http://www.customs.go.jp/english/summary/passenger.htm

Have a copy of your passport ID page and of your flight and hotel
itineraries in a suitcase, especially if you have connecting flight
(less a concern inside Japan).

If you plan to bring some goods home, it's better to bring in your own
extra bag (Nested suitcase or foldable bag you will use as cabin luggage
or secondary checked luggage on your way back). If you need to buy a
suitcase in Japan, don't expect to find cheap Chinese ones. The lowest
price for a suitcase in Japan is over 7500 JPY and usually 10000 JPY
(80 €). Hi Kri5 !

= From/To Airport =

Venue is located in iidabashi which is conveniently a short connection
from Tokyo station or Ueno.

We'll try to host and have Hotels in East Tokyo (Let's say around
Nihombashi) because it's

-  Next to Tokyo station to go everywhere
-  Crossed by Tôzai (East/West) & Hibiya lines (North/South)
-  Not far from Akiba (JEEB)
-  Cheaper (the easter, the cheaper)

\* Suitengu Mae T-CAT Terminal provides Coaches to Airport
http://www.tcat-hakozaki.co.jp/en/ \* Tokyo Yaesu provides Cheap Keisei
Coach (need to book online, standby boarding is not fun)
http://www.keiseibus.co.jp/inbound/tokyoshuttle/en/ \* Ueno has Keisei
Train line to/from Narita, but it's not really faster than Coach since
you need to go to Keisei Ueno. (Warning: that's next to Ueno station)

If you land in HND, then Asakusa Line (becomes Keikyu at some distance)
is the easy way.

= Data plans =

==== SIM ==== Data plans are overpriced in Japan and anti-competitive. I
don't know any European operator offering free data roaming.

Also do not expect to be able to buy a SIM card from any store. Outside
of Airport it will become difficult. Traveling in groups offers a good
opportunity for rental Wifi. Here's a good guide of what to expect:
https://tokyocheapo.com/business/internet/prepaid-cheap-japan-sim-card-options/

Note that our main sponsor, Internet Initative Japan, is also a MVNO
named IIJmio. If you want to support them back you can find the details
here:
https://en.japantravel.com/guide/stay-connected-with-an-iijmio-sim/38705

A cheaper option is to bring in a low cost Asian roaming card, like Thaï
AIS Travel, or China Unicom, but you'll need to buy it remotely.

My own plan is China Unicom Hong Kong, Travel SIM 15 days 8GB
https://www.cuniq.com/hk/data-card/asia . 50extra HKD & 10 days to
deliver. VISA Payment only, there's 2 visa payment modes, use the simple
non register one, confirmation button always on the left. But beware of
potential fraud on CC payment, might use temporary card number.

==== Free Wifi ! ====

Japan has lot of free wifi... but usually needs to register with a
confirmation email ! (Japan...)

If you want to make things easy, get official tourist WiFi app which
will log you in automatically (when it works..)
https://japanfreewifi.com/

= Money (changes everything !) =

Be prepared to pay most of your expenses by '''Cash'''.

Do not expect your VISA card to work in every shop and every ATM (see
below). VISA Japan is not VISA international but use the same logo...
Note that your Embassy is not a travel agency, you will unlikely receive
any help if you run out of cash.

The ATM Network in Japan got better since the last years, and you can
get cash from ATM in any Seven Eleven store, which works 24/24. It has
been expanded to some Lawson & Family Mart. See
https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2208.html

Other well known alternatives are Citygroup banks, and Japan Post
Offices. But beware that like their employees, '''JPost ATM do not work
outside of opening hours''', especially on Sunday !

If you want to secure cash before arriving, and if you're starting your
trip from Paris, the best deal is to head to Rue Vivienne (Metro Bourse)
and find the lower exchange rate there. That tip only works for a fair
amount of money of course.

= Transports =

Fortunately for you, Google maps works (and got progressively accurate)
since few years in Japan. Also, because of the olympics, everything is
now properly translated.

Japan has really good transport network, and always on time, '''but has
plenty of different operators''', which introduces additional connection
costs, and can nullify your passes benefits. (Tokyo Metro pass does not
work on Toei lines) Tokyo Metro Passes
https://www.tokyometro.jp/en/ticket/travel/index.html

If you plan to stay more than 2 days, and/or do not want to buy a pass,
it will be way easier to get a rechargeable SUICA/PASSMO contact card
than buying tickets. Suica/Passmo works almost everywhere, including
train, buses, shops... Again, japan guide is your friend
https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html Check also Citymapper app
for Tokyo buses.

NO Uber. And taxis are expensive.

Note that if you ride a taxi, '''the door will open and close
automatically'''. Since that's not a sliding door, taking a hit in a bad
place is not always fun.

Note also that Taxi signs for Busy are GREEN and '''free sign is RED'''
!

=== JR Pass (and Others !) ===

The popular "JR Pass" is a rail pass for overseas visitors sold by the
Japan Railways Group, and is valid for travel on all major forms of
transportation provided by the JR Group in Japan, with a few exceptions.

Pass is valid for 7, 14 or 21 '''consecutive''' days. Prices when buying
in Japan are ¥33000, ¥52000 and ¥65000.

It can be bought as a voucher, then exchanged on arrival in Japan. Lots
of websites do sell those pass, but prices are linked daily exchange
rate, and might not worth it since it's now directly sold in Japan since
2 years.

Note that either you're buying directly in Japan or exchanging the
voucher, you'll face long queue at exchange/buying point due to flood of
visitors using Rail Pass.

See official website for accurate information:
http://www.japanrailpass.net/fr/

Note that using the Pass is not always the best way, as you might want
to combine flight + regional pass which could be cheaper. (For example,
visiting the Oosaka area can be done for less money and in a more
flexible way by combining local pass and flight, or even *night coach*
which also saves you a hotel night)

See full list of passes here: https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357.html

=== Coaches/Night Bus ===

Japan has a large number of Bus lines running all over the country, and
for really competitive prices.

Additionally they have night buses, and even Bus Passes to save even
more. This is a good option to reach Kansai area.

One of the biggest companies: https://willerexpress.com/en/

Search Engine https://japanbuslines.com/en/

=== Regional Flight Passes and Discounted tickets ===

Foreign people flying on ANA or JAL are eligible for '''regional
passes'''. Those passes need to be booked in advance before departure to
Japan.

Additionaly to the large number of low cost companies which can already
beat the JR Pass, some companies are providing '''special tourist rate
discounted tickets''' on regular flights which could be interesting when
flying to KIX and use a local JR or other Pass for example.

= Japan Sightseeing =

This a ''unofficial'' guide written by [[User:Courmisch|Rémi]], and
ported to the wiki.

Upon not-yet-but-surely-soon popular demand, this is the unofficial VDD
attendee guide to first time Japan sightseeing. Obviously you first need
to determine your time and price budget. Japan is a country with high
living standards and costs.

If you only have a few days in addition to the three days of conference,
you should probably stay in Tokyo. There are plenty of things to see in
the megalopolis; you could invest in a pocket city guide. I personally
perused -the French translation of- Lonely Planet's Tokyo Encounters.

With a week, you can venture outside, but the stereotypical
once-in-a-lifetime (or decade) trip to Japan lasts roughly two weeks,
covering mainly Kanto (Tokyo area) and Kansai (Osaka/Kyoto/Kobe area).
In that case, I may be old-fashioned, but I'd advise buying a country
guide book from your local book shop. Also, as noted in previous
communications, if only to save time, you should check airfares of
multi-city "open-jaw" itineraries arriving in Kansai(KIX) and returning
from Tokyo(TYO) or vice-versa, rather than a round-trip to/from Tokyo.

Japan has excellent public transportation, is a congested left-side
driving country. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use public
transit rather than a rental car. In fact, it can be argued that using
public transit is part of the experience.

== Kanto area ==

Refer to your tourist guide for the key sights of Tokyo. Outside Tokyo,
I would recommend the following day trips:

\* '''Nikko''': major Shinto sanctuary \*\* w/ JRP: ''Tohoku''
Shinkansen to ''Utstunomiya'', then ''Nikko'' line

\* '''Hakone''': hot spring, nature viewing \*\* w/ JRP: ''Tokkaido''
Shinkansen to ''Odawara'', then local line; \*\* w/o JRP: ''Odakyu''
private railway from ''Shinjuku''

\* '''Kamakura''': old capital, major Buddhist sanctuary \*\* JR
''Yokosuka'' line from ''Shinagawa'', ''Totsuka'' or ''Ofuna''

Also be sure to spend one night in a traditional hotel, presumably in
Hakone (for the hot springs).

== Between Kanto and Kansai ==

There are three options to get from one region to the other:

# With a JR pass or with a JR Central Tokyo-Kyoto round-trip package,
you can take the ''Tokkaido'' Shinkansen between Tokyo and Kyoto. #\*
You can buy the JR Central package
[https://www.japanican.com/en/tour/detail/PAS1J02031MKC/?category=914&typecd=TOU&kw=E-Voucher&typegrpcd=TPA
there]. It makes sense if you are too short on time to visit other
cities in Kansai, and both your flights arrive and leave in Tokyo. #\*
Note that JR pass holders are not permitted on the fastest ''Nozomi''
services. # <s>With either a JR pass or an Osaka-Tokyo ''Hokuriku Arch''
Pass, you can take the new ''Hokuriku'' Shinkansen to ''Kanazawa'' The
remainder of line to Osaka via Kyoto is not yet built, so you have to
switch to express train there, which is obviously slower. #\* However,
''Kanazawa'' has one of the best Japanese gardens, so you might as well
make a stop to visit it. #\* You can buy the arch pass from specialist
travel agents, such as
[https://www.jrpass.com/regional-passes/osaka-tokyo-hokuriku-arch-pass#regional_pass_type
JRpass.com]. It is slightly cheaper than the 7-days JR pass, but it is
much more limited in geography.</s> #\* '''Hagibis typhoon has severely
impacted JR East services between Tokyo and Kanazawa. Avoid this
route.''' # Without any pass, you can fly between Tokyo-Haneda (HND) and
Osaka-Itami (ITM). #\* JAL and ANA both have deals for fixed discounted
prices on domestic routes, but compare with list prices. These options
only make sense if you do not have a rail pass of any kind. #*\*
[http://www.nl.jal.co.jp/world/en/japan_explorer_pass/lp/ JAL Explorer
Pass] #*\* [https://www.ana.co.jp/en/fr/promotions/share/experience_jp/
ANA Experience Japan] (The ANA promotion should be valid in November
inspite of indications.) #\* Those deals used to be restricted to
international passenger of the two airlines' respective alliance, but no
longer are.

== Kansai area ==

Obviously, you will want to visit '''Kyoto''', including the gold and
silver temples, the Kioymizu-dera and many more. Given the crowd and the
number of sites, that will occupy a few days.

Ideally, you would book a hotel near the Kyoto central station. From
Kyoto, a must-do day trip:

\* '''Nara''': big Buddha statue, sanctuary with pesky deers... \*\* w/
JRP: JR Nara line; w/o JRP: Kintetsu private railway

Further West, I can recommend the following day trips:

\* '''Himeji''': wooden samurai castle \*\* w/ JRP: ''Sanyo'' Shinkansen
\* '''Takamatsu''': Japanese garden \*\* w/ JRP: express train from
''Okayama'' \*\* Especially if you do not visit Kanazawa.

\* '''Hiroshima''': Miyajima island and ground zero \*\* w/ JRP:
''Sanyo'' Shinkansen; to Miyajima: local train and ferry; to city
centre: tramway

Okayama makes an ideal base for those trips, but anywhere along the
''Sanyo'' Shinkansen works.

== General notes ==

There is no must-follow ordering. This guide starts with Tokyo because
VDD is held there, but you can equally travel west-to-east or
east-to-west.

These guidelines are geared toward self-guided tourists. If you prefer
to spend money to have somebody else guide you, that is of course
possible as well. '''[http://80days.co.jp/ 80 Days]''' is managed by an
acquaintance but there are surely plenty others.

You can buy a voucher for a JR pass from local travel agencies or from
online specialists such as '''[https://www.jrpass.com jrpass.com]''' or
'''[https://www.japan-experience.com/ japan-experience.com]'''. Compare
prices.

Note that the pass is only available in 7, 14 or 21 day spans without
interruptions. If possible, don't have it enabled during VDD's, or even
while staying inside Tokyo.
