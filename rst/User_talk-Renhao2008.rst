I am using VLC to develop our own P2P streaming media VoD system and
it's really a fantastic player. Our streaming media format is WMV and we
encapsulate data in UDP Packet. So I wanna to do some contribute to
VideoLan project. I learned from GSoC2009 List and am interested in the
idea of RTMP implementation for streaming to Flash10. Since I have
experience on streaming media development, I am full of confidence to do
this idea well. I have already leaned some basic concept of RTMP by Wiki
and I wish to ask for some advice on carry out the idea deeply.

Can anybody give me some suggestions, Thank you very much.

By the way, I am from China and I am a graduate student learning in
Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research field is
P2P streaming media system, including both Live and Vod service.

: Can you come on IRC and/or submit an application on the GSoC
application?
