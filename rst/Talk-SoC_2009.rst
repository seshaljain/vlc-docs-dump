Seriously, who cares about SVCD menus? Even when SVCD was popular, there
were like 10 SVCDs with a menu on the whole planet! I would much rather
suggest support for AVCHD and especially AVCHD-menues (such as f.ex.
Toast and Nero produce). Or, as a makeshift, at least fix the broken
.m2ts support in VLC. Or the freeze upon playing certain MKVs for that
matter...
