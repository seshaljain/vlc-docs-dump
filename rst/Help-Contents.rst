Hello, welcome to the VideoLAN Wiki Site!

The aim of this site is to create a site to help document the `VideoLAN software <https://www.videolan.org>`__, a `free <free>`__ and `open source <open_source>`__ media player and streaming solution. This site is a mixture of `glossary <Knowledge_Base>`__, `frequently asked questions <Common_Problems>`__ and `general help <VLC_HowTo>`__.

Finding what you Want to Know
-----------------------------

   *More information:*\ `Help:Searching (at MediaWiki) <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Searching>`__

If you're looking for help about a specific feature, you can `search <Special:Search>`__ for it using the search box on the left of every page.

Otherwise, a good place to start is the `Main Page <Main_Page>`__, which lists all the main parts of the site.

What's a Wiki Site?
-------------------

   *More information:*\ `Wiki (at Wikipedia) <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki>`__

A wiki site is a site which anyone can edit—in fact, we'd like to encourage you to edit pages to make them even better! It works in a similar way to `Wikipedia <https://www.wikipedia.org/>`__.

Adding to VideoLAN Wiki
-----------------------

VideoLAN Wiki requires that you use an account when editing pages, but it's very easy to `log in or register <Special:Userlogin>`__.

When you've logged in you can edit most pages by clicking the Edit tab on the top of the page. Some pages, [STRIKEOUT:like this one,] don't allow you to edit it. This is mainly because they are a target for spam. If you want to edit them, you will need to ask an Admin ([ list of admins]).

Adding to VideoLAN is easy—search for the page you want to add (to make sure it doesn't exist), then click on the "this exact title" link in the first paragraph.

Wiki Formatting
---------------

   *More information:*\ `Help:Editing (at WikiMedia) <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing>`__

When you're editing a page, adding plain text is simple, as you can just type it in. However, if you want to add special formatting – like making text bold – you can also do so.

There are also some `templates <Help:Templates>`__ you can use, for example typing {{wikipedia|Media Player}} will add a box on the right of the page linking to Wikipedia's page on Media Player.
