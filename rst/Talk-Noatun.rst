arts for VLC
------------

VLC could also use arts ... using the arts audio output module. -- `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 16:08, 27 February 2006 (CET)

Proposing deletion
------------------

I'm proposing deletion of this page and talk page, but archival would also be okay. `KDE 2.1 <wikipedia:KDE_2#K_Desktop_Environment_2.1>`__ was released February 2001. It's not current and doesn't have an entry on Wikipedia or KDE.org. Do we keep these things as reference, or do we delete these pages? 06:10, 23 January 2019 (CET)
