A **local area network** or **LAN** links together a limited number of individual computers. Examples include home, library and small campus networks. In most cases this network will sit "behind" a router for Internet access.

The name `VideoLAN <VideoLAN>`__ is in reference to the initial project to `stream <stream>`__ *video* and audio to every computer attached to a *LAN*.

Projects that can be used for network streaming include:
