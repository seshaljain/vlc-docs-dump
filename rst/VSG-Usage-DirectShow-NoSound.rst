No Sound on DirectShow Capture
------------------------------

As odd as it sounds, try setting the sound device to **'none**'.

Also see `this <http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=2859>`__ link.

Also can try to set the audio transcoding to anything besides AAC (see `this <http://betterlogic.com/roger/2010/07/videolan-cannot-stream-directshow-audio-and-video-no-audio/>`__).
