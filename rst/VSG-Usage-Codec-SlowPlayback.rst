==Too slow H.264/MPEG-4 AVC playback==

You can speed up the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC playback by disabling loop filter
for H.264 decoding. To do this go to '''Tools -> Preferences''' (set
Show Settings to All) and '''Input / Codecs -> Other codecs -> FFmpeg'''
and in the drop-down box for '''Skip the loop filter for H.264
decoding''' change it to '''All'''.

You can also try GPU based video decoding (works on NVIDIA Geforce 9xx0
and newer cards also on ATI Radeon HD 5xx0 and newer ones). You can
enable it from '''Tools -> Preferences''' and '''Input & Codecs''' and
tick '''Use GPU acceleration'''.

Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after
that to make sure changes are enabled.{{VSG}}
