This doesn't work for me with DVD items. I can see that the bookmark information is saved in the text of the file, but on loading the playlist into VLC, there are no bookmarks in the bookmarks window --`Hoffman <User:Hoffman>`__ 18:07, 19 January 2008 (CET)

There is not such option in v1.1.0. Please update! --`Meta <User:Meta>`__ 06:10, 11 July 2010 (UTC)
