Could this be added to the Documentation/Module:logo (or whatever it's named) page instead ? `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 11:50, 12 February 2007 (CET)

Well, it should be added, you are right, but not removed from here. HowTo pages should grow in size, not diminuish.\ `J-b <User:J-b>`__ 15:02, 12 February 2007 (CET)
