VLC has lately taken to opening itself very slowly (like, 10 minutes) or not at all. Running W7 32 bit, latest VLC version. Can you help?

   In general, please refer to [//forum.videolan.org/ the support forum] for assistance with your issue; this site is solely for documentation.
   Offhand personal suggestion: have you tried `resetting preferences <VSG:ResetPrefs>`__ or re-installing VLC? If it didn't install correctly, that might fix it.
