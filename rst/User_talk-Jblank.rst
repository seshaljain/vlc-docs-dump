VLC has lately taken to opening itself very slowly (like, 10 minutes) or
not at all. Running W7 32 bit, latest VLC version. Can you help? :In
general, please refer to [//forum.videolan.org/ the support forum] for
assistance with your issue; this site is solely for documentation.
:Offhand personal suggestion: have you tried [[VSG:ResetPrefs|resetting
preferences]] or re-installing VLC? If it didn't install correctly, that
might fix it. :Sorry for the inconvenience, editor
