**High Efficiency Video Coding** or **HEVC** is the upcoming successor to H.264. It is sometimes (unofficially) called **H.265** or **H.265/HEVC** to lend an idea that it builds upon `H.264/MPEG-4 AVC <H.264/MPEG-4_AVC>`__.

It claims a greater `compression <compression>`__ ratio through `lossy <lossy>`__ means at no cost to apparent fidelity. The first version was released in April 2013, though new standards are still being developed.

Like H.264, it is encumbered with patents. The `open source <open_source>`__ version is `x265 <x265>`__.

In , although is used to decode it, is used to encode it.
