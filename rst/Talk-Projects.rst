I don't really understand this page. Is it supposed to list random multimedia related projects? `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 00:54, 17 December 2006 (CET)

   It was supposed to be a list of the multimedia projects related in the Knowledge Base... It should be a category: not a page `J-b <User:J-b>`__ 01:26, 17 December 2006 (CET)
