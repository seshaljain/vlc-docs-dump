Overview of the VideoLAN project
--------------------------------

VideoLAN was a complete software solution for video streaming and playback, developed by students of the `Ecole Centrale Paris <http://www.ecp.fr>`__ and developers from all over the world, under the `GNU General Public License <https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>`__ (GPL).

Originally VideoLAN was designed to stream MPEG videos on high-bandwidth networks, but VideoLAN's main software, VLC media player, has evolved to become a full-featured, cross-platform media player.

Now the Non-Profit Organisation developing and offering the VLC media player is called: VideoLAN Organisation

More details about the project can be found on the `VideoLAN Web site <https://www.videolan.org/>`__.
