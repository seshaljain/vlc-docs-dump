== Howto contact me ==

Use e-mail that is the fastest way. The wiki won't sent an alert to me,
so please use e-mail. I can be contacted either through the vlc-devel
videolan mailinglist or at: jpsaman \_\ `at <>`__ videolan
\_\ `dot <>`__ org (replace \_\ `at <>`__ with @ and \_\ `dot <>`__ with
. )

== not like this == I m interesting in working on RTCP, I have C/C++
programming experience as well. But I am going on vacation for 1 month,
so I be back in August then :).
