This page covers air travel advice for [[VDD19]].

= Arrival =

Your passport must be valid for as long as you would be allowed to stay
as defined by the country visa policy. For visa-free visits, this is
typically 90 days. However German, British and Irish citizens are
allowed for 6 months. As a general, you should always renew a passport 6
months before it expires anyway.

On international flights, you should always carry a receipt of your
flying itinerary - especially return flights, a copy of any reservation
for accommodation, '''a pen in working condition''' and of course the
receipts for any checked-in bags. You will be required to fill a landing
card, which the flight attendants should provide during your flight into
Japan. If you did not get one, you can also fetch one at the airport
border checks.

As a general rule, never bring meat or fresh food through customs. Also
bring a copy of any medical prescription drug. Your bag '''will''' be
checked at customs.

\* Before departure: \*\* Disable roaming data on your phone. \* After
landing you will go through: \*\* thermal cameras (to detect people with
fever), \*\* passport/visa checks, \*\* baggage reclaim, \*\* and
finally custom checks. \* Past arrivals: \*\* Look for an ATM if you
need local currencies. \*\* Look for prepaid data SIM if you pre-ordered
one, or wish to buy one. \*\* Drop your heavy bags at a delivery service
counter (for reasonable price) if you wish. **\* That way, you do not
need to go to your hotel until evening just to drop your bags.**\ \* You
should have your hotel address written in Japanese. \*\* Then follow
signs for the public transit station (see below for airport transfer).

= Airport transfer =

Note: If you can choose to fly through Haneda or Narita, Haneda is most
convenient.

== Haneda (HND) ==

There are two options from Haneda to the city: \* the
[https://www.haneda-tokyo-access.com/en/ Keikyu railway] to Shinagawa
station for ¥300, \* the [http://www.tokyo-monorail.co.jp/english/ Tokyo
monorail] to Hamamatsucho station for ¥500. Both services connect with
the ''JR Yamanote'' loop line for onward travel into Tokyo.

Keikyu is the recommended option, as it is more economical and provides
through services with the Toei metro Asakusa line toward the sponsored
hotel and many other locations. Check your train destination before
boarding - in either directions.

== Narita (NRT) ==

The airport is located quite far from the city, in the neighboring Chiba
prefecture. There are two competing train companies to get to the city:
\* [https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/nex/ Narita Express] \*
[https://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/traffic/index.php
Keisei Electric Railway].

Please note that the first train to the airport starts around 6:00. If
your flight leaves Narita before 9:00, you should really consider
staying at a Narita airport hotel the night before.

=== Narita Express (by JR East) === The Narita Express (N'EX) goes
directly to/from Tokyo central station. \* It constitutes the obvious
choice while holding a valid [http://japanrailpass.net/en/ JR Pass] (or
JR East Pass). \* A discounted
[https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/nex_round.html '''N'EX Round'''] trip
ticket is alternatively valid for return within 14 days. \* For one-way
or half-round trips without pass, consider using Keisei (or a coach)
instead.

=== Keisei Electric railway ===

Keisei operates three different types of services between Narita and
Tokyo-Ueno (actually Keisei-Ueno station).

-  The [https://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/e-ticket/en/
   '''Skyliner'''] is the fastest option to the city. Advance online
   purchases are available at a small discount.
-  The '''Access Express''' follows two different routes: to Ueno, or
   through to the Toei Asakusa metro line. Check the final destination
   before boarding.
-  The limited express is the slowest and cheapest option (save
   coaches).

== Kansai International (KIX) "Osaka" ==

=== Directly to Tokyo ===

This only makes sense with a JR Pass. Get the train tickets at the same
time as you exchange the voucher for the pass: \* JR West's
Kansai-Airport Express to 'Shin-Osaka'', then \* JR Central's Tokkaido
line Shinkansen to Tokyo-Central.

=== Via Osaka ===

-  JR West Kansai-Airport Express with a JR Pass, or
-  Nankai Electric Railway without a JR Pass.

== Chubu Centrair / Nagoya (NGO) ==

-  Meiteitsu Limited Express to Nagoya central, then
-  JR Central's Tokkaido line Shinkansen to Tokyo-Central.

= Departure =

For international flights, it is generally recommended to arrive at the
airport terminal '''2 hours before scheduled departure''', unless your
airline has advised otherwise.

'''Hint''': If you have a local prepaid SIM card and your phone accepts
only one SIM card, inform your local SIM card on your flight booking, so
you will not miss any last minute notice from your airline.

\* Before airport security: \*\* You may want to return your payment
card for refund, if applicable. Or keep it as memento. \* After airport
security: \*\* If you have spare cash, and you will not be coming back
any time soon, you can spend it on overpriced duty-free shops after
airport security. \*\* Be at the gate at the '''boarding time''', not
the departure time.
