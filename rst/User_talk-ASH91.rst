Converting avi files into Mpeg
------------------------------

Hi #, anyone know how i convert an avi movie file into an Mpeg so i can view it on windows media player?

   Hello ASH91,
   You should (I think) be able to play .avi files in Windows Media player. .avi is really a `container <container>`__ format - it's a way of holding video and audio data together. The video and audio data can be in one of many formats, each of which uses a `codec <codec>`__ to decode it. So to play it in windows media player you probably just need the right codec.
   As this is the `VLC wiki <Main_Page>`__, I should tell you a bit about what VLC can do. If VLC can play the file, it can convert it to another format. If you haven't got VLC already, it's a free and `open source <open_source>`__ download. To convert a video's format,just select `Wizard <Wizard>`__ from the file menu and follow the instructions - For mpeg you'll want MPEG-2 Video, MPEG Audio in an MPEG PS format file.
   VLC doesn't support absolutly everything, but it can cope with lots of formats and codecs, and can also cope with broken.files.
