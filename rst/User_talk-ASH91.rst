== Converting avi files into Mpeg ==

Hi #, anyone know how i convert an avi movie file into an Mpeg so i can
view it on windows media player?

: Hello ASH91, : You should (I think) be able to play .avi files in
Windows Media player. .avi is really a [[container]] format - it's a way
of holding video and audio data together. The video and audio data can
be in one of many formats, each of which uses a [[codec]] to decode it.
So to play it in windows media player you probably just need the right
codec. : As this is the [[Main_PageH2g2bob]] 16:59, 30 April 2006 (CEST)
