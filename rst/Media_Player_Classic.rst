Media Player Classic is a `media player <media_player>`__ for Windows released under the GPLv3. It remains active through code `forks <wikipedia:fork_(software)>`__.

Work on the player began in 2003 to resemble `Windows Media Player <Windows_Media_Player>`__ 6.4 with some improvements. When development lapsed in 2007 users were directed to either of the actively-maintained forks *Media Player Classic Home Cinema* (MPC‑HC) and *Media Player Classic Black Edition* (MPC‑BE). Both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries are available, compatible with Windows XP and newer. Numerous `language translations <https://www.transifex.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc/>`__ exist.

Future development of MPC-HC `is inactive <https://mpc-hc.org/2017/07/16/1.7.13-released-and-farewell/>`__ with the latest version being 1.7.13 (released in 2017). There is currently a shortage of volunteers but interested parties with C/C++ experience may contact the maintainer and continue development.
