Media Player Classic is a [[media player]] for Windows released under
the GPLv3. It remains active through code [[wikipedia:fork
(software)|fork]]s.

Work on the player began in 2003 to resemble [[Windows Media Player]]
6.4 with some improvements. When development lapsed in 2007 users were
directed to either of the actively-maintained forks ''Media Player
Classic Home Cinema'' (MPC&#x2011;HC) and ''Media Player Classic Black
Edition'' (MPC&#x2011;BE). Both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries are
available, compatible with Windows XP and newer. Numerous

Future development of MPC-HC
[https://mpc-hc.org/2017/07/16/1.7.13-released-and-farewell/ is
inactive] with the latest version being 1.7.13 (released in 2017). There
is currently a shortage of volunteers but interested parties with C/C++
experience may contact the maintainer and continue development.
