{{muxmod=avcodec|encoder=n}} '''Flash Video''' is a file format mainly
used for playing data in a Flash player on a webpage. It has the
extension '''.flv'''.

There are two types of flv files, the one based on [[H.263]] (which
exists since Flash 6) and another based on [[VP6]] (which was introduced
in Flash 8). In Flash 9 Update 3 Adobe added support for MPEG-4, thus
since this version flv files may also contain [[H.264]] and HE-[[AAC]].

==Compatibility==

H.263 flash video is supported by the latest VLC, with some bugs. There
is a [[Fixing .flv to .avi with FFmpeg|workaround]] using [[ffmpeg]] for
this. VP6 is also supported by VLC from version 0.8.6b and above.

However, seeking, (that is, jumping to a position in the video) is not
supported until 0.9.0 in either codecs.

==Streaming Flash Video With VLC==

Starting from VLC revision 18876 (which means 0.9.0-svn after
17/02/2007), you can stream flash with VLC. You also need to build VLC
with a fairly recent ffmpeg version (r7593 21/01/2007 or newer).

You can then use the following command line to do HTTP Flash Video streaming:
   % ./vlc <input> --sout
   "#transcode{vcodec=FLV1,acodec=mp3}:std{access=http,dst=/stream.flv}"

You can then point any flash based player to that stream using
<nowiki>http://192.2.0.1:8080/stream.flv\ </nowiki> where 192.2.0.1 is
the server IP address.

Note that flash only accepts 3 audio sample rates (44.1 kHz, 22.05 kHz
and 11.025 kHz). If your source audio uses something else, muxing will
fail. You can change the sampling rate by adding samplerate=44100 in
transcode.

==Making VLC the default player for FLV files for MAC and Windows 7, 8==

The instructions for making VLC the default player for FLV files can be
found at the following links:

Windows 7 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eec6M1D3d9s

Windows 8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ2pKsg2kpQ

Note: this and many other video codecs appear to be disabled and
silently not working on Windows binaries, the system won't complain, but
all you find is a container with no video stream in it.
