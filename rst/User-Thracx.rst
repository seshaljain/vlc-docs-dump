Thracx is a new user of VLC but is very optimistic about the
possibilities of the project. He intends to first become more familiar
with the application itself, and then possibly contribute to the project
by extending it's multi-threaded capabilities and possibly making a
Media Library that integrates with VLC.

Thracx currently works as a Software Engineer in the Eastern US, mainly
using C#, Oracle, and Perl, but was educated in C++ with a little Java.
His focus has been on distributed and parallel computing and hopes to be
able to contribute to the VLC project by increasing it's threading
capabilities. Updating the HTTP/RTSP core to be multi-threaded (from the
[[Mini Projects]] page) might be a good start and an excuse to get into
the VLC code base. Getting 'Live Folders' working on Windows might be
another starting task.

Thracx is open to suggestions on what small tasks can be done for the
VLC project to get started.
