VLC is not currently in "Etch", the in-development release of Debian, and won't be added to it because of unresolved licensing issues. You can find out more from `1 <http://bugs.debian.org/vlc>`__.

That's partly inexact. The bug filled is about having a copyright file reflecting all the copyright and licenses present in VLC source code. There is no licensing problem as almost everything is GPL and the few remaining part are under compatible license. The bug is only to have the red-tape completed. --`Xtophe <User:Xtophe>`__ 19:21, 13 August 2006 (CEST)
