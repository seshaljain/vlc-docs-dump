VLC is not currently in "Etch", the in-development release of Debian,
and won't be added to it because of unresolved licensing issues. You can
find out more from [http://bugs.debian.org/vlc].

That's partly inexact. The bug filled is about having a copyright file
reflecting all the copyright and licenses present in VLC source code.
There is no licensing problem as almost everything is GPL and the few
remaining part are under compatible license. The bug is only to have the
red-tape completed. --[[User:Xtophe|Xtophe]] 19:21, 13 August 2006
