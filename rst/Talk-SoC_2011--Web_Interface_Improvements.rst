Hi, I'm currently working on a better WebInterface for luahttp and just noticed this SoC project. Currently my alpha version has some improvements in:

| ``* number requests (no periodic status polling) ``
| ``* transfered datavolume (uses JSON for transfer)``
| ``* performance (e.g. no xml parsing)``
| ``* direct streaming to the browser of playlist items``

some improvements in the future will be e.g. html5 websockets to use server push for status updates (e.g. play status change, seek events, volume events, playlist events etc.) and eventually use of html 5 audio data api for e.g. visualization.

Now I'm thinking about cooperation with you two and like to get in touch. Drop me a message, I'll be glad to share :)

Nik
