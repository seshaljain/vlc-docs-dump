If a video is saved in the Video Lan format, how come when I play it with Windows Media Player there is no sound?

   There is not "VideoLAN format". VLC media player only deal with known formats, not a closed private one.
   I don't think Windows Media Player is able to play a lot of files/codecs (I never use it). Maybe it can't manage your audio codec.

-  You should post your question in the appropriate `forum <http://forum.videolan.org>`__. You can find informations on `Documentation:Streaming_HowTo <Documentation:Streaming_HowTo>`__ page if you are a `command line <command_line>`__ user, there is a transcode option to burn subtitles in the video for example I think.

Hi. I'm thrilled to have VLC Media Player on my Ubuntu O.S. However, I'm having an issue that I can't seem to solve. Whenever I try to view a DVD I get an error message that the movie can't be read. It lists the title of the DVD, but won't read it. I've tried everything I know to do, but obviously there's something I don't know. Can you help me? I'm desperate. Thank you. Fred Broder
