== Project Abstract == The Video Acceleration API is an API designed to
provide hardware acceleration for graphic application using the
processing power of graphic cards. Drivers exists for Intel graphic
cards. A backend for the VDPAU API (by nVidia) has been released and the
same is under way for ATI cards. Thus, this project aims to implement a
decoder and the corresponding video output for VLC, using the power of
VA API to reduce CPU consumption while reading h.264, VC-1 and MPEG-4
videos.
