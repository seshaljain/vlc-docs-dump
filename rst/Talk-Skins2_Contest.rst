   If I remember correctly, `j-b <User:j-b>`__ proposed to offer some gift he received, some monthes ago (from sourceforge or also earlier from elsewhere). Maybe some are left and can be use here if j-b still want to free space in its habitation :). But having its skin set as default in skin2 interface is already a "prize" I think. --`Thannoy <User:Thannoy>`__ 14:20, 11 May 2009 (CEST)
