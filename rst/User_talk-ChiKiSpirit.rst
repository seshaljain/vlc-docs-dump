Hello, my name is Sherry. I am new to working online with videos and I was recommended VLC by a friend. I am not any of the above and I am certainly not "God" but I will help you with English language as much as I can. I'll keep an update of the trials and tribulations that occur along the way and hopefully that may help others who follow in my footsteps.

Have a nice day!

| It took me all day to learn how to download the video from my camera on to my computer. I think because I had "VideoLAN" lurking somewhere in the background it encouraged me to go on further. It took all day and the most part of the night but I did end up with a reasonable result.

The only negative issue I have with the result is that it seems to be taking quite a long time to download on to MySpace.
