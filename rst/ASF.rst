'''Advanced Streaming Format''' (or '''ASF''', later renamed into
'''Advanced Systems Format''') is Microsoft's proprietary digital
audio/digital video container format, especially meant for streaming
media. ASF is part of the Windows Media Framework.

'''Windows Media Files''': ASF files have the file extension '''.asf''',
but ASF files which contain [[Windows Media]] codecs are often given the
file extension '''.wmv''' or '''.wma'''.

'''DVR-MS''': the Windows Vista recording format, should be played (more
or less correctly) by recent VLC versions.
