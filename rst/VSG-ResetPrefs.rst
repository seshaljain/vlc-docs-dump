Many problems with VLC are due to incorrect settings or a broken plugin
cache. You can solve these by deleting VLC's [[preferences]] and cache.

== Reset preferences from VLC ==

=== Using VLC within preferences === If you can launch VLC, in the
preferences dialog, from the Tools menu, you can hit the "Reset
preferences" button.

'''NB:''' This might not solve all your issues, all the time; so if you
still have issues, then see the rest of this article.

== Reset preferences and cache == === Windows ===

==== Using the shortcut in the start menu ==== If you installed VLC
properly you can delete the preferences and cache by simply opening the
shortcut you can find in your start menu:

''All programs > VideoLAN > Reset VLC media player preferences and cache
files''

==== Deleting the files manually ==== Open the explorer and type
''%APPDATA%'' into the address bar and hit enter. This should lead you
to the AppData folder of your user.

Therein you should find a folder named ''vlc''. Delete that folder and
you're done. [[File:Windows_Deleting_Prefs_Folder.png%7Ccenter]]

=== macOS ===

==== Using VLC ==== In case VLC still launches, open it. Select "VLC"
menu -> "Preferences" and hit "Reset All" in the bottom left corner. VLC
will ask for confirmation, reset and restart itself.

==== Manual deletion ====

1) Quit the VLC application.
2) Use a Terminal and enter the following command: ''defaults delete
   org.videolan.vlc''
3) Remove everything from ~/Library/Preferences called
   "org.videolan.vlc.*". Use "Go To Folder" within the Finder's "Go"
   menu to show this folder.

=== GNU/Linux === Delete the <code>~/.config/vlc</code> and
<code>~/.cache/vlc</code> folders or execute '''vlc --reset-config''' in
a terminal.

''Old versions of VLC had the data stored in <code>~/.vlc</code>''

=== BeOS === Delete the <code>config/settings/vlcrc</code> folders.

=== iOS === Delete the app from SpringBoard and re-download it from the
App Store to fully reset the media library and settings.

=== Android === ==== From the settings ==== In ''Settings'', go to
''Applications'' → ''VLC'' → '''Clear data'''.

==== Within the application ==== Go to ''Preferences'' → ''Other'' to
clean the history and the media database.
