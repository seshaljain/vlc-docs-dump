The creative commons is an organisation which promotes making files
available for others to share, work with and build upon, normally for
free. The creative commons publishes a group of licenses which allow a
range of restrictions to be placed on the files, such as requiring that
you give credit to the author of the file, or requiring that it is used
as not-for-profit.
