Also known as `Twoflower <Twoflower>`__ (see also: `VLC CodeNames <VLC_CodeNames>`__).

There was no 1.2.x release (see `release archive <https://download.videolan.org/vlc/>`__); anything that claims to be 1.2.x refers to the pre-release (see `testing archive <https://download.videolan.org/testing/>`__) that was developed into 2.0.0. The pre-release images will probably look identical to the 2.0.x images, but have `a separate category <:Category:VLC_1.2.0-pre_images>`__.
