You can open audio or video files. A file can be opened in two ways.

#. From the **Media** menu select the **Open File** option or the **Advanced Open File** option.
#. Select the **File** tab in the Open dialog box.
#. Enter file name in the **File names** box or browse and select a file.
#. Select a format from the **Filter** list. The supported formats are .a52, .aac, .ac3, .dts, .p3, .ogg, .oma, .spx, .wav, .wma and .wm.
#. Check the **Use a subtitle file** option to select a subtitles file to be viewed with the media file.
   From the **Alignment** list, select an option to align selected subtitle. The available options are Left, Right and Center.
   From the **Size** list, select a font size for the selected subtitle. The available options are Small, Smaller, Normal, Large and Larger.
#. Click **Open**. VLC starts playing the selected file with the default options.

Advanced File Open
------------------

| To open a file

#. Select the **Advanced Open File** option from the **Media** menu.
#. The Open file dialog box is displayed. There are four tabs such as **File**, **Disc**, **Network** and **Capture Device**.

Refer to the following sections for more details:

| `Opening a media file with advanced options <##Advanced_File_Open>`__
| `Opening a folder <#Opening_a_Folder>`__
| `Opening a media disc <#Opening_a_Disc>`__
| `Opening a media network <#Opening_a_Network>`__
| `Opening a capture device <#Opening_a_Capture_Device>`__

Additional Playing Options
--------------------------

When you select the **File** tab after selecting the **Advanced Open File** menu, apart from selecting a file you have the following choices:

**Caching:** When you specify caching value for a media file, the stream is still rendered by VLC media player at the specified data rate, but the client system buffers a much larger portion of the content before rendering it. This allows the client to handle variable network conditions without a perceptible impact on the playback quality of either on-demand or broadcast content. Specify a caching value so that the file is played smoother. The default value is 300 milliseconds.

**Customizing:** File names from different locations can be added directly into the **Customize** box without having to browse the folders.

**Synchronous play:** Play another file in synch with the selected file.

**Start time:** Not play the file from the beginning. If start time is specified as 120 seconds, the file is played after skipping the content of the first two minutes. (Specify time in seconds; not minutes)

Opening a Folder
----------------

You can select a folder to play all media files one after the other in that folder.

#. Select the **Open Folder** option. The Browse for Folders dialog box is displayed.
#. Browse and select the folder.
#. Click on **OK**.

All the files present in the selected folder are played in the alphabetical order, one after another, without expecting any action from you.

Opening a Capture Device
------------------------

A capture device captures an image from a video file or sound from an audio file. Capture devices include webcams, external DVD players, TV cards and acquisition cards. VLC supports capture devices if the devices have the DirectShow compatible drivers.

To capture media

#. Select **Open Capture Device** from the **Media** menu. The Open dialog box is displayed with the **Capture Device** tab selected.

VLC media player supports three modes of capture DirectShow, DVB DirectShow and Desktop.

**DirectShow:** DirectShow, a Windows media streaming architecture, supports capture from digital and analog devices. DirectShow automatically detects and uses video and audio acceleration hardware when available, but also supports systems without acceleration hardware.

**Automatic Gain Control** â Is a circuit found on some electronic devices that automatically controls the gain of a signal. In AGC, weaker signals receive more gain and stronger signals receive less gain or none at all.

-  **Exposure** - Refers to the amount of light allowed to fall on a selected media file while capturing images. There are occasions when you may have to manually adjust the exposure on your camera. Exposure is measured in seconds.
   For example, you have to take a shot of a person from a certain angle, and there is bright light behind the person. In such case, aim your camera on the person and adjust the exposure value by moving the slider. The specified value remains unchanged even after closing the VLC application.
-  **Gain** - This option allows increasing or decreasing the brightness of the video being captured.
   When **Automatic Gain Control** is selected, the values you specified are taken as the default values for Exposure and Gain.
   Uncheck **Automatic Gain Control** to change the values of **Exposure** and **Gain** by moving the sliders.

**Image Mirror**
