**Dummy** means do nothing. It can be applied to lots of different areas, such any `interface <interface>`__, `container <container>`__ or `codec <codec>`__. For input it means there's no input, for output the output is discarded.

Container

.. raw:: mediawiki

   {{mux|id=dummy|encoder=y|altid=raw|altid2=es}}

As a `container format <container_format>`__, it means that data is read or written without a container. For example, `MP3 <MP3>`__ files do not have a container.
