'''Dummy''' means do nothing. It can be applied to lots of different
areas, such any [[interface]], [[container]] or [[codec]]. For input it
means there's no input, for output the output is discarded.

==Container== {{muxencoder=yaltid2=es}} As a [[container format]], it
means that data is read or written without a container. For example,
[[MP3]] files do not have a container.
