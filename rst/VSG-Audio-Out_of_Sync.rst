Audio and Video are out of sync.
--------------------------------

| 
| If you are transcoding a file, use the audio-sync option.

| 
| You can manually set the audio offset while playing (so you can put the audio back in sync).

The default keys to increase/decrease the offset are **Ctrl+K** and **Ctrl+L** in *Windows*, and **f** and **g** in *Mac* (adjust step is 50ms).

| 
| *Linux/Unix*: Try using another audio output plugin and, under Unix, kill esd or artsd if they are running.

| 
| If the problem is due to the input file, try to adjust the track with **Tools > Track Synchronisation**.
