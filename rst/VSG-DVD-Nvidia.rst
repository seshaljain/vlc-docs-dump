== nVidia playback problem ==

Using '''nvidia-xconfig''' with Debian, the screen may go into standby
mode.<br /> This doesn't seem to be a bug with {{VLC}}, but it may occur
when using VLC, such as when watching a movie.

The easiest thing to try is disabling the screensaver through
'''''Preferences''''' → '''''Video''''' → '''''Disable screensaver'''''.

Another approach is to run
   {{$}} xset dpms 0 0 0 && xset s noblank && xset s off

which disables DPMS (Display Power Management Signaling).

If the issue does not resolve, and it seems VLC-specific, then [[report
a bug]].
