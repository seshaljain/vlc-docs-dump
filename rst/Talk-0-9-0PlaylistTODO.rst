Playtree text string formating:

I would like to have more control about the text formating of the playtree object - currently there is a leading path string and no author, playtime, aspect ratio, codec field available in Skins2.

this is a big problem if it comes to professional playback in cinema environments where you have to know what comes next in parts of seconds without an mistake...

would be delighting to discuss solutions to this...

   How would you do see that?
   In fact, there are several options. For example, there could be a popup menu when right-clicking on a playlist item (like in the wxWidgets interface). Or the columns of the control could be adapted, to show different information (obviously, this would have to be made configurable, as different people would not be interested in the same fields).
   My preference goes for the first option, which is easier to implement :)
