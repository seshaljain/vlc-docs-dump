Those are the {{VLC}} mobile recommendations for the video player
interface.

= Gestures = \* single-tap => display the UI \* double-finger tap =>
play/pause \* swipe left/right => seek \* swipe up/down => volume on
right side, brightness on left side \*\* double-finger swipe => so far
nothing, could be longer seek

= Hardware buttons = Control of the volume of media or the application

= Buttons / Controls =

== Left upper corner == \* Stop/quit button

== Controller at the bottom middle == This must be semi-transparent,
(with blur on iOS).

In order of importance: \* Widest Seek Slider as possible, with time
indicators (recommended on both sides) (except iOS, where this is at the
top) \* Play/Pause button \* Lock button (rotation + touch) \* Access to
Audio/Subtitles tracks selector HUD \*\* Including addition of subtitles
if it makes sense (WP) \* Aspect Ratio Button (Pan/Scan) \* Access to
extra panel for extra features \* OPTIONAL Next/Previous button if video
playlist \* OPTIONAL DVD menu button? (rare, missing libVLC)

== Extra Panels == \* Speed selector \* Sync Audio Video Subtitles
tracks \* Video filters \* EQ or other audio filters \* Chapters
selection \* Snapshot ?? \* Access to prefs? Like for subtitles look
control?
