Appleguitar is my code name. My real name is Duncan Chan, from Vancouver BC, Canada.

Introduction
------------

I am very much interested in the VLC project and taking part in Google SoC 2008. There are a lot of cool project ideas from the VideoLAN wiki page, and they all seem very challenging, which is good. It provides a lot of opportunities to learn and code, which is what SoC is all about.
