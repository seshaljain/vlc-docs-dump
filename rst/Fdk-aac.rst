'''Fraunhofer FDK AAC''' is an open-source [[library]] for encoding and
decoding [[AAC]].

Though [[open-source]], it is not entirely free.<br /> Different
open-source communities have different interpretations: \*
[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing/FDK-AAC Fedora] - free \*
[https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=694257#60 Debian] -
undecided after long discussion, assumed to be non-free \*
[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#fdk GNU Project] -
technically free, but dangerous

The {{docmod|fdkaac}} module is based off fdk-aac and used in {{VLC}}
since 2.1.0. It is dual-licenced under
[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#LGPLv2.1 LGPL v2.1] and
