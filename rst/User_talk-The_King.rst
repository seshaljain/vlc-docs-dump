Hello,

I have just downloaded VLC, for the last three hours playing with it &
getting nowhere. There are two PC's on a small home network, one with a
TV tuner card, DVD player, & all the movies. Now I have looked at the
PDF file I have been reading this site. Still meeting with no results
Can someone please point me in the right direction?
