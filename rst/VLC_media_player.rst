'''VLC media player''' (initially [[VideoLAN]] Client) is a highly
portable multimedia player for various audio and video formats
([[MPEG]], [[DivX]]/[[Xvid]], [[Ogg]], and ''many'' more) as well as
[[DVD]]s, [[VCD]]s, and various [[stream]]ing protocols. However in
recent years it has also become a extremely powerful server to stream
live and on demand video in several formats to our network and the
Internet. VLC is made by the non-profit foundation [[VideoLAN]].

It started as a student project at the French
[http://www.centralesupelec.fr/en Ã‰cole Centrale, Paris] but is now a
worldwide project with developers from 20 countries. ([[History|more

VLC is built in a modular way. This means that you can choose from a
range of different [[modules]] to decide how to [[Interface|control]]
VLC and how to display the [[video output]].
