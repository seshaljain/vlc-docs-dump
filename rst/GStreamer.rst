**GStreamer** is an Open Source Multimedia Framework that allows the construction of graphs of media-handling components, ranging from simple mp3 playback to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.

GStreamer is released under the LGPL.
