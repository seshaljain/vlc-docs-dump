Documentation
-------------

Hi. Thanks for writing documentation. I'd really appreciate if you could keep the documentation pages in the Documentation namespace. (As stated here: `Documentation_Talk:Hacker's Guide <Documentation_Talk:Hacker's_Guide>`__ ). Thanks, `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 09:32, 6 June 2007 (CEST)

Hi Dionoea. I'm sorry about using the wrong namespace. I'm still new to the wild world of wikis :) I'll put everything in the right place from now on. As I reverse engineer/understand more of the code I will add documentation and some patches. You guys really do some great work here.
