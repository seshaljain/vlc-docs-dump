Hi. Thanks for writing documentation. I'd really appreciate if you could
keep the documentation pages in the Documentation namespace. (As stated
here: [[Documentation_Talk:Hacker's Guide]] ). Thanks,

Hi Dionoea. I'm sorry about using the wrong namespace. I'm still new to
the wild world of wikis :) I'll put everything in the right place from
now on. As I reverse engineer/understand more of the code I will add
documentation and some patches. You guys really do some great work here.

: I already moved all the pages to the correct namespaces
