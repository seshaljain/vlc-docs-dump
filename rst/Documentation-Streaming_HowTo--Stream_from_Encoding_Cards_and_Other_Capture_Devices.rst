Hardware encoding cards
-----------------------

Note: This is possible under GNU/Linux only.

VideoLAN supports two kinds of MPEG-2 encoding cards:

-  Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-250 and WinTV-PVR-350,
-  Visiontech Kfir.

The Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-250/350 gives much better results and is cheaper than the Visiontech Kfir.

Stream with the Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-250/350 card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you will have to patch your kernel (version 2.4) to support the v4l2 API (Video 4 Linux version 2). The patch is available on the `Video4Linux HQ <http://bytesex.org/v4l/>`__. If you use a 2.6 kernel, you only need to build I2C support and the BT848 Video For Linux module.

Once your kernel is ready, install the CK version (currently in development) of the Linux drivers for the Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-250/350. They are hosted on `ivtv ck <http://67.18.1.101/~ckennedy/ivtv>`__. You will need to patch your kernel to use it with a 2.4. You can also use the CVS version available here: `ivtv.sourceforge.net <http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/>`__ (this version is not developped anymore). Then, you will have to create the device and load the modules; for this, please refer to the documentation shipped with the drivers.

Stream with VLC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note: You must add **--enable-pvr** to **./configure** to use this feature.

where:

-  **/dev/video0** is the device corresponding to the encoding card,
-  **norm=secam** is name of the standard of the analogic signal (possible values are pal, secam, and ntsc),
-  **size=720x576** is the size of the video you want to stream,
-  **frequency=567250** is the frequency in kHz of the channel you want to stream,
-  **bitrate=3000000** is the average bitrate of the stream,
-  **maxbitrate=4000000** is the maximum bitrate of the stream,
-  **1000** is a secret value to work around a bug of the card.
-  **192.168.0.42** is either:

   -  the IP address of the machine you want to unicast to;
   -  or the DNS name the machine you want to unicast to;
   -  or a multicast IP address.

-  **12** is the value of the TTL (Time To Live) of your IP packets (which means that the stream will be able to cross 11 routers).

Stream with the Visiontech Kfir card

.. _install-the-drivers-1:

Install the drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to be able to stream from a Visiontech Kfir card, you need to install its Linux drivers. Download the latest release of the drivers from the `drivers download page <http://www.linuxtv.org/download/mpeg2/>`__ of the `LinuxTV web site <http://www.linuxtv.org/>`__.

Uncompress the tarball and follow the instructions written in the *INSTALL* file to compile and install the drivers.

Note: If you have a VIA chipset, you need to disable USB in the BIOS.

Software encoding cards
-----------------------

Under GNU/Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the Video for Linux drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to stream from an acquisition card or a webcam, a video4linux driver must be available for it. You can find more information about video4linux and supported devices `here <http://www.exploits.org/v4l>`__.

Compile the right module for your device, and insert it into your kernel. Some video4linux modules are shipped with the 2.4.x and 2.6.x Linux kernels, the patch is available on the `Video4Linux HQ <http://bytesex.org/v4l>`__.

You can test your device by using any of the listed programs in the *Video: TV and PVR/DVR* section of `this page <http://www.exploits.org/v4l/>`__.

Note that v4l2 modules will also work with VLC.
