= Draft design for the vout rework effort =

[[VoutReworkUserRequirements]]

[[VoutReworkOrganization]]

== Overall architecture ==

The current system (one vout_thread_t per window) will be splitted

-  vout_core that manages all vout instances and windows. also takes
   care of vout_filters (wall, clone)
-  vout_window object per displayed window. provides a "region for
   vout_renderers" to draw in.
-  vout_render that renders the actual video, text and image

== OSD and subpictures ==

We need to be able to display them either:

-  At video resolution, for DVD subtitles (on the "render")

\* At screen resolution (text subtitles, OSD control) (on the "output")
\*\* This will also allow us to draw subtitles outside of the video
rendering \*\* Probably needs specific code for each vout

At the moment, subpictures have very annoying timing constraints.
subpictures should be timed either on the stream (for subpictures) or
absolute, from the vout_core (for subfilters)

We should create two seperate systems. a vout_render level system which
basically draws extra things into the region provided by vout_window.
This can be both text, images and possibly even video. Material should
be drawn in the resolution of the provided region, instead of the
resolution of the main video. It should be seperate from the spu
streams. However it should be possible to feed SPU based material to the
vout_render system instead of the normal SPU stream pipeline and vice
versa.

Comments from Gibalou: I agree overall but be aware that rendering on
the vout window can be quite tricky. For instance on platforms which
only support 1 overlay (already used by the video), we will have to
constantly refresh the OSD (to handle resizing / refreshing of the vout
window). For this reason I would suggest we keep this feature as simple
as possible and only make it support displaying of subpictures
(subpicture_t/subpicture_region_t).

== Filters ==

Make a clean separation:

\* vout_filters should not be the same as real vouts anymore (will come
from the split) Comments from Gibalou: they don't really need to be
changed since they alreday don't create any window. \* pic_filter \*\*
Currently called video_filter2, should be renamed \*\* Works on a single
pic buffer \*\* Can be streamed Comments from Gibalou: video_filter2 is
not just about 1->1 picture conversion. It is actually designed to work
on video and could for instance allow for temporal de-interlacing,
inverse telecine, etc... So it really is a video_filter and not merely a
pic_filter.

Two big areas of work to be able to integrate video_filters into the
vout core will be:

- Proper support for direct-rendering. Some filters won't actually
modify the video frames directly (eg. auto-cropping) or will do in-place
modifications so they will need to be able to allocate their pictures
from the next filter in the chain and pass it on to the previous filter
when requested. In short, picture allocation needs to be reviewed so it
is done in an optimized way.

- Dynamic modification of the filter chain. Again this is tricky because
the decoder (which does direct-rendering) will be using pictures
allocated from the filter. If this filter changes or is removed, we will
need a way replace the pictures in use by the decoder. That could be
done by having a mechanism that progressively replaces the picture
buffers used by the decoder by indirect buffers and when non of the
direct buffers are in use anymore then we switch the filter. That will
be a lot better then the current way of stopping/starting the decoder.
\* subpicture_filter

== Modularization of specific calls ==

For many of the operations we need, OS specific calls exist (OpenGL,
Quartz, DirectX). This should be modularized, with a native "C"
fallback. OS specific calls are often faster.

There should be only one module for all the calls, if possible. The best
module would be loaded by the vout_core singleton, and function pointers
set up for each of the functions we need. perhaps a vout_Control type
could take care of all these things in the vout_renderer. paramaters
that should be handled this way are at least: alignment, AR, crop, pad

Comment from Gibalou: AR, crop (and soon pad) are already implemented in
the vouts (see below). Alignment is also already supported and is only
about placing the vout subwindow (frame or whatever you call it) into
the main window.

== Misc ==

-  Vout plugins (that provide vout windows) should allow reusing a vout
   by reusing it. This would much improve the experience)
-  Vout windows must have a flag to tell if they are "main" or "helper"
   (audio visualization, ...). Helper vouts should get no OSD (if
   another vout is present) and should not "steal" the accelerated vout"
-  cropping and padding (do at OS level, but provide a core call to set
   it up and configure) '''=> Done'''
-  vout windows should indicate if they are on a 4:3 or 16:9 screen (we
   can calculate this trough resolution). Note that this can change,
   because a window could be moved from one screen to another. Use
   callbacks. '''=> Why would you want to know the AR of the screen ?
   Aren't you confusing with the PAR ? This information could be used by
   the core to facilitate selection of cropping/padding etc for instance
   4:3 display on a 16:9 screen. you might want to crop the top/bottom
   or stretch the view by default. Especially when you are also gonna
   add padding for subtitle rendering for instance, this information
   might become useful.
-  better hotkeys integration: need hotkey module redesign to act on
   selected vout and relevant input instead of the first we find
-  pseudo-hotkeys: ability to move the window by clicking on the video
   and dragging it (in particular for borderless windows).

\* interaction between interfaces and embedded vouts: if the vout window
is moved and/or resized (due to a hotkey), how to notify the interface
(skins engine in particular)? '''

== cropping padding functionality ==

-  add padding in order to display subs under the video. what if we have
   a 4:3 movie in a 4:3 screen? do we create blackbars to the left and
   right sides? do we crop a part of the video ???
-  4:3 cropping to 16:9 (in order to remove blackbars at top and bottom
-  16:9 cropping to 4:3 (in order to remove blackbars left and right
   side)
-  4:3 to 16:9 (AR correction)
-  16:9 to 4:3 (AR correction)
-  AR Freeform
-  Support Moviescreen AR? (2.39:1 or 1.85:1)
-  More info on AR: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)
-  If we let the window provider pass/calculate the AR of the display,
   then we can even do some of this automatically if the uses desires.
-  cropping should have priority over padding. Then we can first crop
   blackbars, then add padding for subs.
-  coordinate specified cropping and padding

Comment from Gibalou: AR / Cropping (and soon Padding) has already been
reworked and is now handled directly in the vout module (makes sense
since cropping and resizing are supported by most sane graphic APIs).
All this is controled from the core by setting the relevant parameters
in vout_format_t. Now, what could be done is to add extra logic (eg. in
video_filters) to do some clever things like auto-cropping, etc... All
they need to do is to modify video_format_t to change the final
cropping/padding/AR.
