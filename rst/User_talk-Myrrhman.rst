Your contributions
------------------

All your three contributions are (were) around links to the same macos-related website which do not contains VLC articles (iirc only one article have "vlc" word inside and it is not about ). Those links appear off-topic and badly inserted into this wiki.

For your information: I just deleted the last remaining link you created on this wiki. --`Thannoy <User:Thannoy>`__ 10:07, 27 October 2010 (UTC)
