Shoutcast is `proprietary <proprietary>`__ software primarily used for listening to `web radio <web_radio>`__. `Icecast <Icecast>`__ is the `open source <open_source>`__ version and is currently used in .

Replacement
-----------

Shoutcast was removed completely in 1.1.0. A `VideoLAN Press Release - Shoutcast <https://www.videolan.org/press/2010-1.html>`__ noted *We want to emphasise the fact that features like SHOUTcast or icecast browsing are now doable using our new extension framework and you will find user-contributed extensions on*\ https://addons.videolan.org/.

There are `add-ons for Internet radio available at addons.videolan.org <https://addons.videolan.org/browse/cat/322/order/top>`__ but standard installs of recent versions might already be enough. VLC before and after the replacement look much the same, and both seem to allow online listening: |Shoutcast (0.9.4)| |Icecast (<1.0.6)|

The steps differ slightly: open the playlist and select "Icecast Radio Directory" instead of "Shoutcast Radio".
