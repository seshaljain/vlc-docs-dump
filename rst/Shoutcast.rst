{{Wikipedia|Shoutcast}}

Shoutcast is [[proprietary]] software primarily used for listening to
[[web radio]]. [[Icecast]] is the [[open source]] version and is
currently used in {{VLC}}.

== Replacement == Shoutcast was removed completely in 1.1.0. A
[https://www.videolan.org/press/2010-1.html VideoLAN Press Release -
Shoutcast] noted ''We want to emphasise the fact that features like
SHOUTcast or icecast browsing are now doable using our new extension
framework and you will find user-contributed extensions on
https://addons.videolan.org/''.

There are [https://addons.videolan.org/browse/cat/322/order/top add-ons
for Internet radio available at addons.videolan.org] but standard
installs of recent versions might already be enough. VLC before and
after the replacement look much the same, and both seem to allow online
listening:

(0.9.4)]] [[File:Shoutcastdirectory.PNG%7Calt=%7Cthumb%7Cright%7CIcecast
(<1.0.6)]] {{Clear}}

The steps differ slightly: open the playlist and select "Icecast Radio
Directory" instead of "Shoutcast Radio".
