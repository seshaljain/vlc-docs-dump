MP4, 3GP or MOV files with no audio
-----------------------------------

If those files have AMR audio (usually ones from mobile phones) they won't work with VLC versions under 2.0.

MOV file doesn't play in VLC, but plays well in QuickTime Player.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

| Follow these steps to fix this issue:

-  Open the URL in QuickTime Player.
-  Let it decide which data rate is best for your connection.
-  Let it play for a few seconds, then pause it.
-  Open the stream info, copy the url.
