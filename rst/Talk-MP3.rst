== Dummy vs. Raw Container ==

When I want to transcode a file into MP3 using the Export/Streaming
Wizard, the '''codec''' should be set to ''MP3'' and the '''container
format''' to ''raw''. Raw might be a dummy, but the description in the
article is a bit confusing because there is also a dummy codec.
