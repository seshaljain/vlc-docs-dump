Dummy vs. Raw Container
-----------------------

When I want to transcode a file into MP3 using the Export/Streaming Wizard, the **codec** should be set to *MP3* and the **container format** to *raw*. Raw might be a dummy, but the description in the article is a bit confusing because there is also a dummy codec. --`Robb Dub Funk <User:Robb_Dub_Funk>`__ 22:16, 28 August 2007 (CEST)

   I kind of agree. (although both might be valid solutions ... but I always advise to use raw or es for the mux when outputing mp3 audio files) Feel free to change the article. --`Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 17:40, 6 September 2007 (CEST)
