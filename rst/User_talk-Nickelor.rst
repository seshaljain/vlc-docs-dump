Hi, I see that you've been adding content to the VideoLAN wiki. Note
that this wiki is meant to be used for VideoLAN related topics. General
articles like IPv4 or IPv6 can already found on other websites (like
wikipedia). Unless you have a good reason to write such an article here,
I'll delete the two pages. [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 18:32, 15 September
