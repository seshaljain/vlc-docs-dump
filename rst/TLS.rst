{{Wikipedia|Transport Layer Security}}

'''Transport Layer Security''' or '''TLS''' is the successor to the
earlier Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). When correctly deployed this form of
encryption makes it harder for third parties to eavesdrop, spoof or
alter electronic communications.

It is necessary for sensitive information transfer, but it can be used
for anything. See for example the [https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere
HTTPS Everywhere] campaign.

{{VLC}} has supported TLS for the [[HTTP Interface]] and HTTP stream
output since 0.8.1, TLS for VoD since 0.8.2, and TLS for ftp and sout
access since 2.2.0. In 3.0.0 an HTTP/TLS access module was introduced
for HTTP 2.0 support.
