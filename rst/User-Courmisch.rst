RÃ©mi Denis-Courmont, courmisch on git and [[IRC]].

I wrote the [[Unicode]] layer, the new [[RTP]] input, [[TLS]] and
[[SRTP]] cryptography plugins, most of the XCB (X11) support, [[MIDI]]
plugins, udev integration, the transparent file decompression plugin,
ARM NEON assembly optimizations. I also maintain the core networking and
threading code, and am involved with various other parts of VLC.

I am the acting maintainer for the minisap server project.
