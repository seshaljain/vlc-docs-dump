Nightly builds are VLC binaries compiled every day at midnight using the latest development version.

These builds can be found at http://nightlies.videolan.org/ .

These are **pre-alpha** builds; they are expected to be unstable. They usually have all the latest cutting-edge features of the next major version.

Use this version to `report bugs <report_bugs>`__, as this is what the VLC developers work with every day.
