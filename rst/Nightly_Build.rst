Nightly builds are VLC binaries compiled every day at midnight using the
latest development version.

These builds can be found at http://nightlies.videolan.org/ .

These are '''pre-alpha''' builds; they are expected to be unstable. They
usually have all the latest cutting-edge features of the next major
version.

Use this version to [[report bugs]], as this is what the VLC developers
work with every day.
