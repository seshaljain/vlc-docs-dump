{{Mmwiki|Frame Types}} A frame is a still image. Video is made up of
many frames per second to create the illusion of movement.<br /> The
number of frames to be displayed per unit of time is expressed in
''frames per second'' (fps) or ''Hertz'' (Hz). These are different terms
for the same measurement.

Key frames (keyframes) and I-frames are the
same.<sup>[[#note_1|&dagger;]]</sup>

Digital video compression techniques involve [[compression]] of frames:
;I-frame: A full ''''I'''ntra-coded picture' ;P-frame: ''''P'''redicted'
from previous frame(s)'s picture ;B-frame: ''''B'''i-predictive' or
''''B'''idirectional' calculated from surrounding frames's pictures. Can
painlessly be skipped.

interchangeably, a ''key frame'' is an ''I-frame'' with the property of
being a point from which a decoder can start decoding</small>
