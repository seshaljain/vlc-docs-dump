I also want to give my big thanks to the videolan team.

I still remember that in 2003, I had to rummage through various media
players like FLV player and Divx Inc's player, tolerate Quicktime
getting possesive on my system and PowerDVD's double windows. Not to
forget WMP, which,as the versions progressed, it devoted less and less
space for videos, even in full screen.

Now, I just install VLC and forget about different formats. Also, I love
the fullscreen controls, the ability to jump to 3 seconds ahead or
behind and of course the quality of the [http://moovieland.blog.com/
movies] video playback.

Keep up the good work.
