== General presentation == Hello! My name is ''Anthony Loiseau''.

I worked around {{VLC}} with [[User:RemiiiCyril]],
[[User:Sinseman44Poe]] (were workmates in the so called
''RatatouilleTeam'') in Actech (Angers, France) on an IP PVR project
named Cybervia.

Why does Actech help(ed) VideoLAN? (through us and through
[[VideoLAN_Sites#Servers|skanda]] hosting donation)

Because VLC is a great and free tool, it decodes many formats and can be
embed in web pages. We can look into its source code to understand
better how we can take advantage of it. We use it and we are proud to
promote it in our product (check our [http://www.cybervia.com/ website]
for more informations about our IP PVR).

see you!

==VLC project==

My work will be mainly focussed on mozilla-plugin and activeX parts of
VLC. '''Since I didn't worked on VLC lately, most of informations
written bellow are out-of-date.'''

===Mozilla plugin===

The file projects/mozilla/control/npolibvlc.cpp describe the API which
should be accessible by moz-plugin. The dedicated page for its API is
[[Documentation:Play_HowTo/Advanced_Use_of_VLC#Use_the_mozilla_plugin|here]].

====List of methods which should be accessible====

Here is the list extracted from the file
''projects/mozilla/control/npolibvlc.cpp'' by a script(will be given
soon, need doc, clean and a little debug maybe) :

== VLC tips ==

=== First steps in compile process ===

First compile attempts are more difficult than further ones, mainly
because of missing third-party packages. You can get a list of those
packages here : [[Contrib_Status]]

The proper way to compile is described in many places ([[UnixCompile
\|boostrap, configure, make, make install]]). At configure stage, you
can be informed of missing needed packages. You should look its output
to find many problem origins.

I suggest you to store its output to a file. Like this you will be able
to get a look at ".. no" ending lines at anytime. To do such, you can
use "tee" command on linux (it archive a copy of the output to a file) :
./configure --all --your --args=here \| tee my_configure.out

When a package is missing, saying for example "ffmpeg/avcodec.h", you
have to find a package about it (in fact libavcodec-dev in this case)...

On debian based distros, you can find libavcodec-dev in those ways :
   apt-cache search avcodec # or with a graphic tool: synaptic

and you can install this package in those ways (with root privileges) :
   apt-get install libavcodec-dev # or with a graphic tool: synaptic

=== debian etch gettext and git-core ===

On debian etch (4.0r3), some packages are quite old. Too old for
videolan. You can get up-to-date packages using [http://backports.org
backports]. Its usage is explained on its website.

Packages I have packported are: \* git-core \* git-email \* gitk \* wine
(only needed to work on ActiveX API, IDL cross compiler) \* wine-dev
(only needed to work on ActiveX API, IDL cross compiler)

What about gettext? Only release 0.16.1 is available, even in backports. For now I have modified configure.ac in this way:
   AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION(0.16.1)

instead of 0.17.

NB : You can use backport inside synaptic GUI through "force version"
menu item.

=== mozilla-sdk under debian Etch ===

If you have problems finding mozilla-sdk, try to install package
''libxul-dev'' and add to your ./configure the parameter
''--with-mozilla-sdk-path=/usr/lib/xulrunner/sdk''

Resume :
   su apt-get install libxul-dev exit

   ./configure '--with-mozilla-sdk-path=/usr/lib/xulrunner/sdk'
   ...with-your-other-params... # with other-params including
   "--enable-mozilla", otherwise I don't think mozilla-sdk is useful for
   you

<small>''keywords : mozilla-sdk mozilla-config.h libxul-dev configure
/''</small>, <small>'''not tested'''</small>

=== undefined symbol: XpmReadFileToImage ===

Recently, I have had a problem running mozilla plug-in. It was because
for libvlcplugin.so, ld never tries to find symbol XpmReadFileToImage
into the right lib (libXpm.so). Here is a workaround which have worked
for me :

   1- su # ask for root console 2- vi /etc/ld.so.preload 3- if the file
   is empty then add /usr/lib/libXpm.so else append /usr/lib/libXpm.so
   to its content. each libs must be separated by a space

      endif

   4- close vi (ESC : w q)

<small>''keywords : undefined symbol: XpmReadFileToImage
/usr/lib/libXpm.so /''</small>

==Tools==

===Firebug=== Having a JS debugger is very useful to test
mozilla-plugin. [http://www.getfirebug.com/ Firebug] is a wonderful
Firefox extension for that stuff.
