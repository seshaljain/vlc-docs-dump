VLC Global Hotkeys are shortcuts you can use even if VLC does not have the focus. Here is how to configure Global Hotkeys:

-  Tools, Preferences, HotKeys.
-  Under the **Global** column, double-click the value corresponding to the function you want a global key assigned to.
-  Press the key or key combination you want
-  Click Apply
-  Click Save

You will have to quit and restart VLC for the new assignments to be effective.

To unset/clear a global hotkey: Proceed as if you wanted to set a new key, but press the pause/break key.
