Changes between 0.8.6 and 0.9.0
===============================

Important notes
---------------

-  This version of VLC contains a `new interface <Qt_Interface>`__ for Windows and Linux. This interface lacks a few features that used to be present in vlc 0.8.6:

   -  "Streaming wizard" and "VLM control". These features will be replaced by a better alternative in the next version. If you absolutely need these features, we advise you to keep vlc 0.8.6
   -  Similarly, "Bookmarks" will be reintroduced in an improved version at a later point

-  The default Interface is now `Qt Interface <Qt_Interface>`__ on linux and windows.
-  The default for --sout-keep has changed. It's now activated by default.
-  The marq, mosaic and logo commands in the `rc interface <Console#rc_interface>`__ changed. They now require a target name as their first argument. Example:

   ::

      vlc --sub-filter "marq@test{marquee=Hello}" -I rc <somevideo> 

   You can then use commands like:
   ::

      @test marq-marquee Goodbye

   These new commands are also available in the `telnet interface <Console#telnet_interface>`__.

-  The `HTTP Interface <HTTP_Interface>`__ is now only available on the local machine by default.

   If you want to make it available from other machines, you will have to edit the ".hosts" file.

   -  On UNIX/Linux, the file is in /usr/share/vlc/http/.hosts

      If you're using the old http interface, it's located in /usr/share/vlc/http/old/.hosts

   -  On Windows they are in C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\http\.hosts and C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\http\old\.hosts
   -  On Mac OS X, you can find it in VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/http/.hosts and respectively in VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/http/old/.hosts

-  The "`rtp <RTP>`__" access output module has been removed:

   Please use the RTP stream output instead, e.g.:
   Old: '#std{access=rtp,dst=239.255.1.2,sap}'
   New: '#rtp{dst=239.255.1.2,sap}'
