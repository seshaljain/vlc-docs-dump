Proposed VDD sessions
---------------------

Saturday
~~~~~~~~

VLC 2.2 and 3.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What's left to be done for 2.2? What are our goals for 3.0? What's the time frame for the next major release? How can we avoid to repeat the 2.2 delay?

VLC Mobile Remotes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a major feature missing in VLC's mobile apps, which is currently provided through third party apps. Control VLC remotely running on a desktop. What needs to be done both on client and server-side to provide an advanced and seamless integration between the platforms?

VLC Subpicture Framework improvements for hwaccel rendering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of today for picture type subpictures (DVB Subtitles, VBI pages, ...) a software scale step is forced into the pipeline. To make better use of hardware being able to render scaled overlays this shall be omitted. But it seems some significant changes in the VLC core are required to support this in a common way, which some brainstorming on would be required.

Android
^^^^^^^

iOS
^^^

WinRT
^^^^^

libav/FFmpeg discussion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Better understanding leads to better cooperation.

Sunday
~~~~~~

Libav 12 and 13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Roadmap, `Blueprints <http://wiki.libav.org/Blueprint>`__ and so on.

Libav whining
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have complaints: do voice them! (we will listen and will address them)

Libav infrastructure discussion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugzilla customizations, gitlab, gogs, plaid, and other tools to make our life easier by making some admin life miserable.

Road towards HWAccel 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During this year we moved two steps towards version `https://wiki.libav.org/Blueprint/HWAccel2 2 <https://wiki.libav.org/Blueprint/HWAccel2_2>`__:

-  1.2 -> default context allocators
-  1.3 -> bitstream-oriented hwaccel support

During this session we will discuss about how to provide an uniform structure to avoid even more boilerplate code and still allow full control to the people needing it.

ChromeCast
^^^^^^^^^^

How do we achieve VLC using Chromecast?

Media Library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Current state and conception of needed functionality for a cross-platform library to collect meta data, thumbnails and so on for use within media handling applications based on libvlc. Written in C++.

EBU-TT-D
^^^^^^^^

integration in VLC and/or ffmpeg ?

x264 meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Opus in MP4
^^^^^^^^^^^

We should sit down and design this mapping.

Binary Album Art extensions for Ogg
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We've had a proposal to include binary (not base64-encoded) album art for Ogg in the context of Ogg Opus: <http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/codec/current/msg03061.html>. This session would determine if there is interest from players in supporting such an extension and working on the design.

Testing
^^^^^^^

Seems like everybody is doing the same very flaky or very manual thing when testing video processing and player software. Can we do better?

   like a fate suite of tests for players? Maybe with an scriptable mouse click? Assuming your player can be launched in a set coordinates.

Broadcasting things
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An attempt to justify what broadcasters are doing.

arm64 / AArch64
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CPU specific optimizions for iOS devices, upcoming android devices, arm based servers

The bare basics of special relativity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An brief introduction to the basic concepts and consequences of special relativity.

Chocolate
^^^^^^^^^

`Chocolate orders delivery <VDD14/Chocolate>`__

Daala
^^^^^

Open to anyone curious about Daala, and if you want to win a T-shirt we'll help you write your first patches! See also https://wiki.xiph.org/Daala_Quickstart

Wayland
^^^^^^^

Principles, challenges, progress and way forward with multimedia on Wayland

`Category:VDD <Category:VDD>`__
