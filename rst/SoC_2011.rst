and VLMC.

[[:Category:SoC_2011_Projectseparate page]].

== Introduction &amp; Information ==

This wiki page covers the attempt by the [[VideoLAN]] project to act as
a mentoring organization for [http://code.google.com/soc/ Google Summer
of Code], in order to improve {{VLC}} and [[X264]], the H.264 video
encoder.

[[VideoLAN]] was a mentoring organization in [[SoC 20072008]], [[SoC
20092010]].

*This page list the ideas for VLC and VLMC*\ There is also a separate
page for project ideas for [[X264]]: '''[[SoC x264 2011]]'''.

If you are a '''student''', please read [[SoC 2011 Rules|the rules and
advice]].

=== VLC media player ===

{{VLC}} is a cross-platform multimedia player, encoder and streamer
application. It is one of the most successful open-source projects
without any professional structure underneath.

{{VLC}} is downloaded at an approximate monthly rate of 5 millions from
the main website and that's not including third-party distributions
(Linux)!

You can find more information on
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player VLC on Wikipedia] or on
this [[Main Page|wiki]].

=== x264 ===

[[x264]] is probably the most popular open source video compression
software, used worldwide for applications such as web video, television
broadcast, and Blu-ray authoring. It outclasses practically all
commercial implementations both speed and compression-wise. While not
actually part of VLC or ffmpeg, it is a major library used by both,
licensed under the GPL. Due to its popularity in the commercial world
(for example, Youtube and Facebook rely on it), many companies have
offered bounties in the past for features and improvements that they
found useful.

=== Summer of Code ===

If selected and developed, SoC projects for VLC will be included in
later releases; SoC projects for x264 will be included in the main tree
of the project.

All projects are covered by the GPL licence. (v2+)

== Ideas == === VLC and VLMC ===

'''''Read this'''''

This page is split in three lists of ideas:

#The ''main ideas'' are what seem to be ''key projects'' for VLC and
should be more ''thrilling'' than the other ones; we have assigned a
potential mentor to each of these. #The other ideas are less detailed
but could be good ideas too. #VLMC ideas #[[Mini Projects]] are
short-span projects which can be given as Qualification tasks or
extended to be Full Summer of Code project.

\*'''Original good ideas will be valued'''. Last year, half of the ideas
were given by students. We don't want to impose anything. This is free
and Open Source software.

If you don't want to apply for SoC but want other ideas to develop on,
check the [[Mini Projects]] page!

And on the IRC channel, you can have even more ideas.

=== Ideas for x264 ===

For x264 ideas, please see [[SoC x264 2011]].

== Key ideas for VLC ==

=== New Audio Filters ===

We are looking for a skilled '''audiophile''' that knows a lot about
audio theory and practice:

*to create or implement new algorithms, like SRS WoW or other 3D
effects*\ to work on channels mixing, *to work on tracks mixing,*\ to
create scriptable new audio filters in lua and enable users to create
whatever audio filtering function they want in a Lua script. \*LADSPA or
other libraries integration will be interesting.

This project needs some good audio knowledge and good C experience.

''Qualification task'': port any audio filter from MPlayer

''Proposed mentor: [[User:Geal|geal]]''

=== Porting Audio Filters ===

We are looking for a skilled '''audiophile''' that knows a lot about
audio theory and practice: \* to port open source algorithm for audio
filters to VLC.

This project needs some good audio knowledge and good C experience.

''Proposed mentor: [[User:Geal|geal]]''

=== UPNP DLNA Server and Client ===

Test and fix service discovery module for UPNP/DLNA shares done by
software (mediatomb, xbmc, etc) and hardware implementations.

Provide DLNA plugin for DLNA server compliant with opensource (xbmc,
djmount, etc) and proprietary (PS3, xbox360, etc) DLNA clients. Some of
the work is already done by previous SoC students.

The plugin must be smart enough to provide "presets" for known DLNA
media clients with limited features (PS3 or XBOX360 for starters) which
require additional quirks or hacks or items to be transcoded or
streamed.

Requires some VLC knowledge as the project will involve using Media
Library (arriving in vlc 1.2) and transcoding with VLC API.

''Proposed mentor: thresh''

=== Assembly optimizations in VLC ===

If you are fond of writing ASM and you are fluent in MMX/SSE2/SSE4,
there are many interesting things in VLC to speed up.

-  Profiling VLC.
-  memcpy implementations in SSE\* and MMX (see
   modules/misc/memcpy/fastmemcpy.h)
-  video filters ASM speedups (see modules/video_filter/blend.c)
-  audio filters ASM speedups (see modules/audio_filter/equalizer.c)
-  Porting other ASM video filters to VLC.

This project needs some good ASM knowledge and good C experience.

=== VLC Android Port ===

Improve current VLC
[http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc/vlc-android.git;a=summary android port],
improve/add native/java interfaces and design and implement a GUI. The
project can be broken into:

-  Build libvlc jni, understand LibVlc.
-  Design and implement a cool GUI with gestures and using LibVlc
   implement callbacks, map user events etc.

''Proposed mentors: ivoire''

=== VLC Test Suite ===

This project aims at making automatic tests to improve VLC quality.

*Write a series of tests for vlc-internal*\ Integrate a framework for
automated plugins testing with the automake build system *Automate the
different codec playback/mux/etc tests*\ Automate the subtitles tests
\*Write tests for the different bindings: Mac OS X Framework/Python
Bindings... etc.

This project is a code project, require good knowledge of C

''Proposed mentor: Rémi''

=== VLC Personnal Cloud Project 2.0 ===

The personal cloud project is a simple project to allow people to play
their media files anywhere in the world.

Through the http interface of VLC, a user can:

*list the medias from the Media Library,*\ play those medias, *those
medias get transcoded and streamed in:FlashSilverlightiPhone
formatAndroid formathtml5*\ \*A VLC webplugin

A good example of the aim is http://www.vodobox.c.la/

This project has to work on the configuration and NAT traversal.

This projects needs knowledge in HTML and JS; it might require C coding.

''Proposed mentor: jb''

=== VLC for Anime ===

We are looking for a skilled '''anime fan''' that knows a lot about
anime theory and practice to work on the optimisation of VLC for anime.
Ideas include:

-  Improvement of MKV demuxer for special anime needs
-  Subtitles display improvements
-  video filters that make sense for anime
-  metadata and extensions.

''Proposed mentor: jb''

=== SVCD/VCD improvements ===

Menus and such needs to be improvements and fixed.

Proposed mentor: "fenrir"

=== Automatic LibVLC bindings generation ===

libVLC can be used from several programming languages like Java or
python to embbed VLC feature inside another application. Anyway,
maintaining these binding is power consuming. VLC needs a way to
automatically generate theses binding for a large set of programming
languages and keep them up-to-date easily. We advice to use Swig (from
http://www.swig.org/) but any other tool is accepted too. \* [[SoC
2011/Generator of libVLC bindings for other languages|Generator of
libVLC bindings for other languages]]

''Proposed mentor: ivoire''

=== OMA/Atrac improvements ===

We need to improve the oma demuxer to support more features and work on
the ATRAC3+ decoder in libavcodec, so people can play their files from
MiniDiscs.

''Proposed mentors: Adrian, Michael or other people from
linux-minidisc''

=== Playlist improvements ===

We need to reinforce the media library capabilities and its integration
with external metadata sources, notably for TV shows.

''Proposed mentor: jetru''

=== AirTune streaming ===

We need to be able to stream everything to your iPhone.

'''Proposed mentor'''

=== BD-J / BD-Live ===

This is a project to go on the work of last year on Blu-Ray Menus

This project requires Java knowledge

''Proposed mentor: jb'''

=== [[SoC 2011/Web Interface Improvements|Http interface improvements]]
===

This is a project to fix and extend the http inteface (also called
oldhttp)

The http interface is used by many remote control apps on various
platforms. This project would improve the capability of the interface -
and thus enable more features in the various remotes that use it.

\* get the album art working **the interface is supposed to return the
current album art at /art (assuming 'export album art' is enabled)**\ at
the moment, this simply doesn't work. *enable playlist re-orderingat the
moment, there is no way in the http interface for the playlist order to
be changed*\ enable access to the graphical equaliser **should provide a
list of presets available**\ should provide info on each slider **should
allow user to select a preset**\ should allow user to adjust a slider
*speed controlallow speed to be set in the form
host:8080/requests/status.xml?command=speed&val=<someVal>show current
speed as part of the status.xml response*\ subtitle delay control
**(similar to speed control) \*audio delay control**\ (similar to speed
control) *enable selection of a subtitle file (by path)*\ add
'unminimise' command to the fullscreen command \*\ *the current
fullscreen command just sets the bool value of fullscreen in VLC.
However if vlc is minimised on Ubuntu (possibly windows), then
fullscreen does nothing. To work as the user would expect, the
command=fullscreen should a) set fullscreen b) unminimise VLC*\ add
ability to control picture controls (brightness, contrast, etc)
*implement pl_delete on luahttp*\ allow user to get drives list on
windows (in oldHttp, user can browse to c:/..)

\*and lots more...

== VLC&nbsp;Student Proposals ==

=== Mobile Remote Control ===

(proposed by akashm1990)<br>

The aim is to make a mobile remote control application for VLC running
on the PC. This would be a native application.<br>

The application will run on a mobile phone connected to the local
network over WiFi.(probably using the http interface)<br>

In addition to the usual remote control functionalities such as
play,pause, open new file,volume control,etc. the application aims to
implement 2 specific functionalities:<br>

*On receiving an incoming call, if a video is playing on the PC, it will
pause, or if music is playing, the volume may reduce. (user
configurable)<br>*\ On receiving an incoming text message, the video
playing on screen is paused and the text is displayed onscreen. After a
predetermined period of time, the video starts playing again.<br>

Target Platforms: Android(primary), Symbian-QT (If time permits) <br>

A video showing the auto pause functionality using Android emulators and
the VLC Python API is shown here: <br>

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou5prh-EoBs

== VLMC ==

VLMC is a non-linear cross-platform video editor based on VLC. We're
looking for student(s) with good C++ skills and some experience with Qt
with lots of passion of hacking.

Hang with us at #vlmc or #videolan on irc.freenode.net and talk to the
developers directly!

To get selected:

1. [http://wiki.videolan.org/Building_VLMC Download and build] VLMC and
   start playing with it.
2. Implement some feature(s) or fix some bug(s), search VLMC's
   [http://trac.videolan.org/vlmc/report bug tracker].
3. Send your patch to vlmc-devel@videolan.org for evaluation and work on
   your GSoC proposal.
4. Get selected and work on your project!

<br> You'll be greatly appreciated if you complete any of the proposed
qualification tasks: (in increasing level of difficulty)

1. [http://trac.videolan.org/vlmc/ticket/134 Bug 134]: Update labels and
   strings when locale is changed.
2. [http://trac.videolan.org/vlmc/ticket/61 Bug 61]: Improve project
   timeline widget to have clip thumbnail.
3. [http://trac.videolan.org/vlmc/ticket/145 Bug 145]: Project preview
   has no sound on Windows.
4. [http://trac.videolan.org/vlmc/ticket/196 Bug 196]: Fix distorted
   audio playback in project preview.
5. [http://trac.videolan.org/vlmc/ticket/144 Bug 144]: On some
   platforms, rendered video file has no sound. Identify the problem and
   fix it.

=== GUI Improvements ===

Difficulty: Medium

Proposed mentor: etix

VLMC needs a GUI make over, using Qt APIs such as graphics view,
animation, states etc. Correcting those widgets such as the import
window, provide alternative widget so VLMC better fits with the video
editing needs.

Many widgets can be rewritten&nbsp;: Import, Library, Clip property...
be creative&nbsp;!

=== Quality Improvements: Writing Tests and fixing LibVLC APIs ===

Difficulty: Hard

Proposed mentor:&nbsp;? (needs a VLC developer to mentor this one)

While rendering preview and project, VLMC may sometimes crash due to
bugs in the libVLC. The project will consist of; writing (unit)
tests/test-cases for VLMC/libVLC APIs, and identify what's causing the
crashes and fixing the bugs. The major area is rendering. Testing should
be verified on at least two of the OSs: Linux, Windows and Mac. This
project can help VLMC have stable releases and better quality control.

=== Plugin Architecture for VLMC ===

Difficulty: Hard

Proposed mentor:&nbsp;?

VLMC uses frei0r plugins to add special effects. The project consists of
designing and implementing a plugin architecture that can take in
lua/python/compiled-plugins(.so) plugins.
