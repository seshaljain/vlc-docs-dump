{{wikipediaSource-specific multicast}}

Multicast, in contrast to [[unicast]], sends a message to multiple
clients. Source-specific multicast (SSM) is a form of multicast that
accepts packets only from specific senders. Other protocols that exist
are [[anycast]], [[broadcast]], [[geocast]] and [[unicast]].
