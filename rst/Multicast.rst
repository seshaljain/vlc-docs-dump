Multicast, in contrast to `unicast <unicast>`__, sends a message to multiple clients. Source-specific multicast (SSM) is a form of multicast that accepts packets only from specific senders. Other protocols that exist are `anycast <anycast>`__, `broadcast <broadcast>`__, `geocast <geocast>`__ and `unicast <unicast>`__.
