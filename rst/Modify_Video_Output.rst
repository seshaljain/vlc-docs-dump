   {{howto|modify your video output}}

If you have no video for some type of files or all of them, you can try to change the video ouput.

Go to **Tools** > **Preferences** > **Video** and in the **Display** section, try another *Ouput*.

Sometimes, you have to deactivate the **Accelerated video output (Overlay)** too.
