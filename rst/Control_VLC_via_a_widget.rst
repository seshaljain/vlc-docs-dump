control VLC over the network.

\*It is a free widget which works using the [[Web_Interface \| http

\*Autopoetic provide instructions on installation, however since 0.9.6
there is an additional step required to allow networked control. You
have to edit the .hosts file to allow connections to be made on the
local network, or from the whole internet.
