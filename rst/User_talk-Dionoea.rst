The thing
---------

Hello! I'd like to suggest `The thing <User:The_thing>`__ is considered for sysop status. His `contributions <Special:Contributions/The_thing>`__ have lots of reverts to previous versions (ie, spam removed), and this task is a million times easier with the ability to rollback pages. His user page is a bit strange, but other than that he's doing a great job. --`H2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 16:32, 28 May 2006 (CEST)

   Well, uh of course I 2nd that. `The thing <User:The_thing>`__ 18:40, 28 May 2006 (CEST)

      Done :) Thanks for the help -- `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 21:20, 2 June 2006 (CEST)

         Your Welcome. `The thing <User:The_thing>`__ 20:40, 3 June 2006 (CEST)

Google map
----------

I know you posted ages ago (sorry, was doing my dissertation like a crazy fool over easter) but if you still want to add me to Google map thing, I'm at:

   <marker username="h2g2bob" fullname="David Batley" location="Exeter, UK" blurb="" lat="50.749056" lon="-3.530045" title="Developer"/>

I can't edit /team/team.xml myself - no SVN access :( It's interesting to see how many Europeans there are. Plus Xtophe is just (well 100km) down the road - how cool! --`h2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 18:08, 24 April 2007 (CEST)

   Done. Thanks. `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 18:05, 30 April 2007 (CEST)

demux
-----

Hi,

On `Demuxdump <Demuxdump>`__ the following example is given :

``vlc http://example.org/shoutcast.mp3 :demux=dump :demuxdump-file=output.mp3``

You say that the ":" syntax is correct (by the way I didn't get anything out of you explantion in the Edit page). If it is, then can you explain to me why this actually does *not* work on my mac:

``vlc http://213.205.96.91:9915 :demux=dump :demuxdump-file=output.mp3``

giving the following errors:

| [00000278] access_http access: Raw-audio server found, mp3 demuxer selected
| [00000281] demuxdump demuxer: dumping raw stream to file \`/Volumes/Proton/output.mp3'
| [00000281] demuxdump demuxer: closing /Volumes/Proton/output.mp3 (0 Kbytes dumped)
| libdvdnav: Using dvdnav version 0.2.0cvs from http://dvd.sf.net
| libdvdread: Using libdvdcss version 1.2.9 for DVD access
| libdvdread: Can't stat demuxdump-file=output.mp3
| No such file or directory
| libdvdnav: vm: failed to open/read the DVD
| [00000283] main input error: no suitable access module for \`:demuxdump-file=output.mp3'
| [00000271] main playlist: nothing to play

while this one works:

``vlc http://213.205.96.91:9915 --demux=dump --demuxdump-file=output.mp3``

Thanks.

Editing Guidelines
------------------

Hi Dionea! Sorry for that one. I just oversaw the Editing Guidelines. As I've got some spare time the next month, I'd love to contribute to VLC. As I'm (by now) not that good a coder, I thought I'd start with the wiki (which is a rather easy field). So, are there any tasks which are of high priority? Also, as I'm not that very familiar with the inner workings VLC, is there any particular developer I can contact when I stumble upon something I don't understand (j-b?)?

   Hello,
   You should try hanging out on the #videolan IRC channel on Freenode. People there will be able to give you ideas. Contributions can be source code, but we'd also be really interested if you feel like writing (or at least help writing) some documentation. Depending on what you want to work on, different people will be able to help ... I can't name any universal VLC guru as none exists (well ... none of the folks that are on IRC).
