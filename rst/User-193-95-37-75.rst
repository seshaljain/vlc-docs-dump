The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a reliable transport
protocol that provides stable, ordered delivery of data between two
endpoints (much like TCP) and also preserves data message boundaries
(like UDP). However, unlike TCP and UDP, SCTP offers such advantages as
multi-homing and multi-streaming capabilities, both of which increase
availability. In this article, get to know the key features of SCTP in
the LinuxÂ® 2.6 kernel and take a look at the server and client source
code that shows the protocol's ability to deliver multi-streaming.

SCTP is a reliable, general-purpose transport layer protocol for use on
IP networks. While the protocol was originally designed for telephony
signaling (under the RFC 2960), SCTP provided an added bonus -- it
solved some of the limitations of TCP while borrowing beneficial
features of UDP. SCTP provides features for high availability, increased
reliability, and improved security for socket initiation. (Figure 1
shows the layered architecture of the IP stack.)
