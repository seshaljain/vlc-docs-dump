My name is Antoine Lejeune. I am a student of École Centrale Paris and University of Liège.

I'm currently working on building a new VLC interface for Maemo (debian-based development platform for devices such as Nokia N800 and N810 internet tablet). See `SoC 2008/New VLC interface for Maemo <SoC_2008/New_VLC_interface_for_Maemo>`__.

I'm also working on a media library for VLC as a second year project at École Centrale Paris.
