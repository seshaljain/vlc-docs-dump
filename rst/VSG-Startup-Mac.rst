Starting VLC in the MAC OS X Desktop
====================================

Please check that you are using the latest release of VLC.

If so, run the "Remove Preferences" script provided on VLC's disk-image or delete both a folder called "VLC" and a file called org.videolan.vlc.plist in ~/Library/Preferences (your personal preferences folder).
