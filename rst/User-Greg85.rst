General Presentation

Hello! My name is **Grégory Meunier**.

I'm a student in Polytech'Nantes and I'm working around VLC during a school project with Actech (`Thannoy <User:Thannoy>`__ and `Remiii <User:Remiii>`__) in order to find a possibilty to optimize its functioning in streaming mode. I'm just a beginner but I hope I'm going to get more familiar with the code soon.
