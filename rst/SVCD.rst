**SVCD**, or **Super Video CD** is a way of storing a video on a `CD <CD>`__ in a similar way to storing it on a `DVD <DVD>`__. It is (of course) generally lower quality than a DVD due to the smaller size of a CD rather than a DVD.

Compatibility
-------------

SVCDs often do not work in VLC Player. VLC can sometimes play SVCDs using `libcdio <libcdio>`__ and `libvcdinfo <libvcdinfo>`__ - the `features <http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html>`__ page has more details. For a complete VCD/SVCD which includes menu selections, hot spots and playback control, see `xine <http://www.xinehq.de>`__.
