Hello,

We are having an issue where the VLC Media Player 0.8.6c is not able to
recognize movies DVD's .

The VLC player has been installed on customer's HP's Notebooks HP NC6400
series, running XP Professional SP2 (own customer's ISO image) and
having as video adapter solution the (UMA) Intel Graphics Media
Accelerator 950 . The machine installs a Matshita's DVD drive UJ-842S.
The issue is very specific to the above customer's configuration.

The media DVD's are recognized by the drive if the customer install
Intervideo WinDVD(any versions) or Windows Media Player (11).

Are you aware of any such issues occurred with VLC Player and the
solution taken to resolve the problem?

Thanks a lot in advance for your ready help.

You should ask such questions in the VLC forum. Noone is going to read
your user pages. See http://forum.videolan.org/
