Hello,

We are having an issue where the VLC Media Player 0.8.6c is not able to recognize movies DVD's .

The VLC player has been installed on customer's HP's Notebooks HP NC6400 series, running XP Professional SP2 (own customer's ISO image) and having as video adapter solution the (UMA) Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 . The machine installs a Matshita's DVD drive UJ-842S. The issue is very specific to the above customer's configuration.

The media DVD's are recognized by the drive if the customer install Intervideo WinDVD(any versions) or Windows Media Player (11).

Are you aware of any such issues occurred with VLC Player and the solution taken to resolve the problem?

Thanks a lot in advance for your ready help.

You should ask such questions in the VLC forum. Noone is going to read your user pages. See http://forum.videolan.org/ `Ustunozgur <User:Ustunozgur>`__
