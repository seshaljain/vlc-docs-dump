Issue with the decode of mp4a (aac), powerpc can decode without auto
defects but x86 processors can not. I am looking at the code, i can't
seem to see where the problem might be. Does anyone on the development
team have input on this topic? : The wiki is not the approprate place to
ask for help. 1/ People don't read it often (and few do) 2/ Mailing
lists, IRC and the forums are likely to get you an answer faster.
