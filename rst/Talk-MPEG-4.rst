Issue with the decode of mp4a (aac), powerpc can decode without auto defects but x86 processors can not. I am looking at the code, i can't seem to see where the problem might be. Does anyone on the development team have input on this topic?

   The wiki is not the approprate place to ask for help. 1/ People don't read it often (and few do) 2/ Mailing lists, IRC and the forums are likely to get you an answer faster. `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__
