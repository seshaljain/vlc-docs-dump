This pages lists rules that should apply to '''all''' pages in the
Official Documentation (ie the Documentation:\* namespace in this wiki).
Feel free to discuss additions to this list on the
[[Documentation_Talk:EditingGuidelines|discussion page]].

== Editing ==

If you are unsure about something you'd like to add to the
documentation, please discuss it first in the page's discussion page
before adding it. We want to keep this documentation as accurate as
possible. (People often review the wiki so you're likely to get feedback
in a few days time)

== Structure ==

All docs (Play HowTo, Streaming HowTo, Hacker's Guide, etc.) should
start by defining base concepts and gradually cover more advanced
topics. The user should be able to read it sequentially (like any other
online documentation, but unlike most wikis).

One exception to this rule is the Documentation:Modules/\* space. Each
of these pages is to focus on a specific module, containing greater
detail than the basic documentation.

== Formatting ==

Page formatting needs to be kept consistent. Check existing pages to see
what that means.

== Links between different docs ==

These are of course allowed. Just keep in mind the "Structure" rule :)

== Links to other wiki pages and websites ==

The documentation needs to be self-contained. Definitions of important
concepts should be in the documentation. This makes it possible to
export it as a PDF and keep it understandable. <br/> Links to advanced
topics, like what you have in the "SEE ALSO" section in Unix man-pages,
are of course OK.

== Images == Upload images the usual way: [[Special:Upload]].
