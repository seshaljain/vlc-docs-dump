This pages lists rules that should apply to **all** pages in the Official Documentation (ie the Documentation:\* namespace in this wiki). Feel free to discuss additions to this list on the `discussion page <Documentation_Talk:EditingGuidelines>`__.

Editing
-------

If you are unsure about something you'd like to add to the documentation, please discuss it first in the page's discussion page before adding it. We want to keep this documentation as accurate as possible. (People often review the wiki so you're likely to get feedback in a few days time)

Structure
---------

All docs (Play HowTo, Streaming HowTo, Hacker's Guide, etc.) should start by defining base concepts and gradually cover more advanced topics. The user should be able to read it sequentially (like any other online documentation, but unlike most wikis).

One exception to this rule is the Documentation:Modules/\* space. Each of these pages is to focus on a specific module, containing greater detail than the basic documentation.

Formatting
----------

Page formatting needs to be kept consistent. Check existing pages to see what that means.

Links between different docs
----------------------------

These are of course allowed. Just keep in mind the "Structure" rule :)

Links to other wiki pages and websites
--------------------------------------

| The documentation needs to be self-contained. Definitions of important concepts should be in the documentation. This makes it possible to export it as a PDF and keep it understandable.
| Links to advanced topics, like what you have in the "SEE ALSO" section in Unix man-pages, are of course OK.

Images
------

Upload images the usual way: `Special:Upload <Special:Upload>`__.
