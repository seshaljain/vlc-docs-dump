About this Page

We could maybe merge the (unmantained) FAQ with this wiki page. We'd loose the translations in this process but it would be up to date. `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__

   Yeah, it's a good idea - it'll save people having to look at a million pages --`H2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 17:54, 14 January 2006 (CET)

"syntax error before "pthread_spinlock_t"" on debian-Etch or CentOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have added `this tip <Common_Problems#.22syntax_error_before_.22pthread_spinlock_t.22.22_on_debian-Etch_or_CentOS>`__ in the article, since I had this error and drewby(IRC) too. Me on a debian Etch and drewby on a CentOS.

If somebody have crossed the same error using another linux distro, feel free to change the tip name to best fit the reality of impacted distros. i have only seen feedbacks from those two.

--------------

Malgré l'évident intéret de l'utilisation de l'anglais dans nos communications, je suis persuadé que les débutants (dont je suis :-) gagneraient à utiliser le français pour comprendre les bases.

Un exemple:je ne suis pas totalement maladroit en anglais, mais je n'arrive pas du tout à faire ce que je veux et pas du tout à comprendre la moindre solution à mes attentes !!

Le Wikipédia se prête naturellement à ce multinlinguisme, pourquoi ne pas le faire ici ?

| *Oh yeah! I totally agree. Why don't we all communicate in our native language? There is no doubt that I'd understand the beginner section a lot better if it was in Norwegian...*
| 

Seriously, norwegian is not near to be be as widespread as french, but there really are a lot of other languages that would be real "contenders" to french. I.e. spanish or even chinese? But is it really feasible to think that all the beginner sections can be translated? Why not instead make a list in the wiki showing users sorted based on nationality, and maybe also create national wiki-sections for this purpose (if it isn't already done that is, I am totally fresh in here). What I just said here might be what you said yourself in french above. But I really wouldn't know if that is the case, because - well, it's french... :). Then again - Marc might not understand a bleeping word of what I am saying here, so maybe someone with both english and french linguistic skills could translate this to Marc, just so that we can communicate properly ;)

No pun intended, **Ronny** :D

Windows ME video not displayed correctly
----------------------------------------

Hey there,

I think VLC is so awesome, and it runs perfectly. Well, except for video on WinME. I had seen something on the VideoLAN website that said something about you needing to download an extra thing for WinME. Can someone tell me what that is and provide a link to it?

Skips at beginning of chapters
------------------------------

I'm running VLC Player 0.8.6c on a MacBook OS X 10.4.10. I have 1 GB of ram. When I play some DVDs with VLC, they skip at the beginning of each chapter. This problem does not occur when I play DVDs with the Macintosh DVD Player. Any help? `Hotdoglives <User:Hotdoglives>`__ 04:36, 16 November 2007 (CET)
