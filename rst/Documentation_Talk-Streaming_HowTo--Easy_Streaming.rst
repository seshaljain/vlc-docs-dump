documentation, tutorial or both
===============================

Was the intention of this documentation to be a tutorial? `Tyneto <User:Tyneto>`__ 11:18, 6 February 2008 (CET)

streaming desktop tutorial
--------------------------

I want to stream my desktop using 'screen://' and I've opened "Open network stream" as my first step. Default value is "UDP/RTP" with port 1234. I've selected in 'advanced options' "Stream/Save". (this I learnt from the wiki videolan easy streaming tutorial) . My problem is that in the customize field it says : "udp://@" . Where is it best to put the "screen://" thing so I can stream my desktop in the network? `Tyneto <User:Tyneto>`__ 11:38, 6 February 2008 (CET)

Doesn't match VLC GUI I have
----------------------------

The VLC GUI displayed in the documentation does not match what I see. I can find no Wizard.

I have tried several different options, but cannot capture a stream from VHS to USB interface to a file. I can watch the video, but not save it.

Is there any simple documentation to tell me how to do that?
