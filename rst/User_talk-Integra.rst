upload of interface image
-------------------------

-  You uploaded `an image <:Image:Interface.png>`__ of the windows 0.9.x interface. Could you link it to related articles? --`Thannoy <User:Thannoy>`__ 10:10, 15 December 2008 (CET)
-  Ok, so working on `Documentation:VLC for dummies <Documentation:VLC_for_dummies>`__ page, a good idea. But why didn't you use `:Image:Vlc-en.png <:Image:Vlc-en.png>`__? Nevermind, thanks :) --`Thannoy <User:Thannoy>`__ 13:24, 15 December 2008 (CET)
