{{Wikipedia|RTP Control Protocol}}

'''RTCP''' or '''RTP control protocol''' is a [[protocol]] that works
with RTP (Real-time transport protocol).<br /> Whereas [[RTP]] sends
media (e.g. a video stream) over an Internet connection. RTCP sends
information about the quality of the stream &ndash; things like dropped
packets or skipped frames &ndash; to report the status of the connection
itself (and a few other things). It does not send any media whatsoever.

Informally, it's similar to the "Tools" -> "Media Information" ->
"Statistics" display that the Qt interface of VLC will show about
playing media.
