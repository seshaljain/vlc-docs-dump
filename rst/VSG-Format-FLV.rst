== Trouble playing Flash Video Files<br> ==

<br>

Flash Video support has been added (provided through ffmpeg).

To view [[.flv]] files you will need version 0.8.4a. Download and
install the latest version [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ here].<br>

VLC still has problems with a few .flv files. If you have problems
playing a file in VLC you might be able to change it to an [[avi]] using
[[ffmpeg]]. See [[VLC HowTo/Transcode from Flash Video format]].

<br>VLC 0.8.6 provided enhanced Flash Video support on all platforms, so
it is probably worth to update if you experience problems with prior
releases.<br>
