Trouble playing Flash Video Files
---------------------------------

| 
| Flash Video support has been added (provided through ffmpeg).

| To view `.flv <.flv>`__ files you will need version 0.8.4a. Download and install the latest version `here <http://www.videolan.org/vlc/>`__.
| VLC still has problems with a few .flv files. If you have problems playing a file in VLC you might be able to change it to an `avi <avi>`__ using `ffmpeg <ffmpeg>`__. See `VLC HowTo/Transcode from Flash Video format <VLC_HowTo/Transcode_from_Flash_Video_format>`__.

| 
| VLC 0.8.6 provided enhanced Flash Video support on all platforms, so it is probably worth to update if you experience problems with prior releases.
