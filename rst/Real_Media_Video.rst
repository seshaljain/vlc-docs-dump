**RealMedia Video** is the video `codec <codec>`__ used in `RealMedia <RealMedia>`__ files, which are played on `RealPlayer <RealPlayer>`__. The Real Media Codecs are proprietary, which makes their support in other applications pretty difficult.

Compatibility
-------------

Some versions of RealMedia video format can be played with VLC, but in your RealMedia file, there's all sorts of networking stuff, and it is that which causes problems. See `RealMedia <RealMedia>`__ for more details.

The `helix <helix>`__ player and `RealPlayer <RealPlayer>`__ is better at playing this kind of file.
