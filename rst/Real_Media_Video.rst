{{websitehttp://www.real.com}} '''RealMedia Video''' is the video
[[codec]] used in [[RealMedia]] files, which are played on
[[RealPlayer]]. The Real Media Codecs are proprietary, which makes their
support in other applications pretty difficult.

== Compatibility == Some versions of RealMedia video format can be
played with VLC, but in your RealMedia file, there's all sorts of
networking stuff, and it is that which causes problems. See
[[RealMedia]] for more details.

The [[helix]] player and [[RealPlayer]] is better at playing this kind
of file.
