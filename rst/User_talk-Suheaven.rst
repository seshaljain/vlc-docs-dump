Hi, my name is Hang Su, a graduate student from the
[http://www.gucas.ac.cn/gscasenglish/index.aspx Graduate University of
Chinese Academy of Sciences ].

I'm interested in the GSoC VLC project and I think it will be a great
opportunity to practice my skill of programming and team working if I
can take part in the GSoC programme of VLC.

'''UPnP media service''' is my interested point as I have studied and
solved the NAT travesual problem using the method of UPnP for a Live
streaming broadcast programme 1 year ago.

Here I'm wondering about the request ' Having a cross platform solution
is almost a must' listed under the title of '''UPnP media service''' .
Does that means the developer should give out different versions of the
UPnP module for different platforms(Windows/ Linux)? Or the whole VLC
solution could give out the adapter layer for different platforms to
make the differencese invisible ?

You can contact me by email : suheaven@gmail.com or on the talk page
here. Thank you !
