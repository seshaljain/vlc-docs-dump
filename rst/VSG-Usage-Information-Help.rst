== Use VLC's help documentation<br> ==

If you can't find anything about your particular problem in the
internet, you should try the function VLC has for the command line.

<br>

Open your command-line and write “'''vlc –help'''” in it.

You´ll now have a .TXT file created, which contains VLCs command-line
options. Your screen will now show you a list, which you can browse
through to find your problem.

<br>

If you still cannot solve your problem try to write the following in the
command-line. <pre>“vlc -p module –advanced” </pre> <br>
