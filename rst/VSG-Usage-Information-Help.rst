Use VLC's help documentation
----------------------------

If you can't find anything about your particular problem in the internet, you should try the function VLC has for the command line.

| 
| Open your command-line and write “\ **vlc –help**\ ” in it.

You´ll now have a .TXT file created, which contains VLCs command-line options. Your screen will now show you a list, which you can browse through to find your problem.

| 
| If you still cannot solve your problem try to write the following in the command-line.

::

   “vlc -p module –advanced”
