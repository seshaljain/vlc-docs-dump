Those rules are mostly for x264 and VLC.

``Those rules are quite flexible for any situation.``

Rules
=====

*We don't like rules.*

*We like freedom and having fun with software programming.*

However, we have no choice, seeing past experiences and issues. :'(

Summer Generalities
-------------------

If you are a student, we expect that:

-  You don't have a full-time job during your summer if you are doing SoC at the same time,
-  You are of good will to work within VideoLAN team.

If you are a mentor, we expect that:

-  You are willing to work with one student and answers his questions.

Selection
---------

To be selected, students will have to:

-  Show on IRC,
-  Join the mailing lists (x264-devel or vlc-devel, according to your project),
-  Select an idea,
-  Say hello to the potential mentor and admin.

-  Learn about the code you should modify (where in the source, what is the idea...),
-  Be able to compile a VLC for your platform (for VLC development) and learn how to use `Git <Git>`__.
-  Show the team that you compiled VLC, by probably provide a small patch and a build. You can send the patch to an admin or to vlc-devel@

Examples of small patches:

-  

   -  Fix warnings,
   -  Add some simple feature that sounds nice to you,
   -  Close a VLC bug on trac,
   -  add a dropdown choice for audio devices to the Direct Sound output module,
   -  Make it possible to change the list of destinations in a duplicate stream output element dynamically,
   -  Extend the DBus control to activate a video filter on the fly on an already playing video.
   -  Add RMI (RIFF MIDI) support to the SMF demux
   -  Last.fm radio playing
   -  libsox based module

-  Complete the Google admission and give a planning idea.

During the summer

Student expectations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Student should explain his planning to his mentor and to an admin (not everyone has the same vacations)
-  Student should report with a small mail once a week to both mentor and admin during the time agreed (failure to do that will fail the application)
-  Student should commit on his personal *git branch* once a week, except the first week of your schedule (or more if your project is complex).

**Explaining why you can't work one week is fine. Disappearing without notice is not.**

-  Update wiki status page.

Student rights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Ask questions and stupid questions to anyone
-  Bother the mentor with questions
-  Ask the admin for another mentor if the mentor doesn't answer or doesn't fit.

Students will be considered as **full-right** developers.

Mentor expectations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Mentor should report to admins any problems as soon as noticed,
-  Mentor should tell admins if they can't make it in order to have another mentor for the student.

Mentor rights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fail a student :D
