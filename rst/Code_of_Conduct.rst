   {{DISPLAYTITLE:VideoLAN Code of Conduct}}

You should check out our `shared values <VideoLAN_Values>`__.

Communications rules
====================

The following rules apply to all means of communication, online and in real life.

-  Do not use foul language, and absolutely NO insults will be tolerated.
-  Be careful with direct criticism:

   -  Focus on the possible improvements and do not make the issue a personal one.
   -  You should, when possible, criticize in private, and praise publicly; since most of our communications are public and people can be sensitive about that.

-  *Ad hominem* attacks are not accepted.
-  Do not flame or troll; it is not funny.
-  Do not undo someone's else contribution (wiki edits, code reverts, etc...) without asking first.
-  Send all communication in English.

   -  The *videolan@* mailing list, wiki translated pages, and forum-specific topics allow different languages, when clearly flagged.

-  Do not send spam.
-  Do not abuse administrative powers.
-  These Code of Conduct rules are not exhaustive; please use common sense, to infer other rules.

Mailing lists
-------------

When using the VideoLAN mailing lists, please follow also these simple rules:

-  The mailing lists exist to foster the development and use of VideoLAN. Unconstructive and off-topic messages, along with other abuse, are not welcome.
-  Make sure that you are using the proper list. In particular, don't send user-related questions to developer mailing lists.
-  If you want to explain to someone how to use a mailing list, please do it privately.
-  Do not quote messages that were sent to you by other people in private mail, unless agreed beforehand.
-  When replying to messages on the mailing list, do not send a carbon copy (CC) to the original poster unless they explicitly requested to be copied. When replying on a private mailing list, this does not apply as the recipient would not be able to read the reply otherwise.
-  If you send messages to lists to which you are not subscribed, always note that fact in the body of your message.

Mailing list Etiquette
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Wrap your lines at 80 characters or less for ordinary discussion. Lines longer than 80 characters are acceptable for computer-generated output (e.g., ls -l).
-  Avoid top-posting in conversations.
-  Avoid HTML-only messages; have a plain text version instead.
-  Avoid sending large attachments; mails with attachments over 65kb will have to be moderated by administrators.
-  Do not send automated "out-of-office" or "vacation" messages.
-  Do not send "test" messages to determine whether your mail client is working. We have a `test mailing list <https://mailman.videolan.org/listinfo/test>`__ for that.
-  Do not send subscription or unsubscription requests to the list address itself; use the respective -request address instead.

IRC
---

When using the VideoLAN IRC channels, please follow these rules:

-  Do not quote messages that were sent to you by other people in private query, unless agreed beforehand.
-  If you want to explain to someone how to use IRC, do it privately.
-  Never send messages with colours (i.e. colour codes); use plain text instead.
-  Do not send "test" messages to determine whether your IRC client is working. We have a #test channel for that.

Forum
-----

-  Do not bump a topic several times per day.
-  Do not cross-post your question across sub-forums.
-  Do not edit your past posts overly often.

Bugtrackers
-----------

-  Do not change priority or importance lightly.

Code repositories: Git / SVN / HG
---------------------------------

-  Do NOT engage in revert wars.
-  Do NOT delete another developer's commit without approval by using push --force.
-  No insult in commits or commit messages.
-  Respect the correct `commit log style <http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`__.

Real life, Conferences, Meetings and Assemblies
-----------------------------------------------

-  Absolutely no violence will be tolerated,
-  "No" means "**No**",
-  You get one warning from the board first, and then you're out,
-  This also applies for the community day of `VDD <VDD>`__.

Disciplinary actions
====================

Violations of the Code of Conduct will be punished.

See the following guidelines for escalations steps and sanctions.

Escalation
----------

#. The first violation will always result in a simple warning, except if it is a grave or deliberate violation.
#. The following violations will result in some of the disciplinary actions listed in the paragraphs below.
#. For repetitive violations, the case may be escalated to the VideoLAN board and general assembly for further disciplinary actions.

In case of any disciplinary action, a VideoLAN board member will send an email to the offender and copy the association mailing list.

Disciplinary Actions
--------------------

The following disciplinary actions may be enforced when a direct Code of Conduct violation is reported.
