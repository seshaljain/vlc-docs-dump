== VLC crashes / freezes / BSODs my computer<br> ==

<br>

VLC doesn't do that. Normal apps shouldn't be able to cause issues like
these to operating systems. <br>

Culprit is usually bad device driver (for example display adapter
driver, soundcard driver, chipset driver, network adapter driver etc.)
or broken hardware.<br><br>If you still cannot trace out the problem
then try resetting VLC Settings by the following procedure:<br>

If you can start VLC, go to '''Tools''' -&gt; '''Preferences''' and then
press '''Reset Preferences'''. '''Save''' to reset and save VLC
settings.

Remember to restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

<br>

If you can't start VLC, go to '''%appdata%''' folder and delete
'''vlc''' folder from there.<br>
