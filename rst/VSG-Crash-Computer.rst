VLC crashes / freezes / BSODs my computer
-----------------------------------------

| 
| VLC doesn't do that. Normal apps shouldn't be able to cause issues like these to operating systems.
| Culprit is usually bad device driver (for example display adapter driver, soundcard driver, chipset driver, network adapter driver etc.) or broken hardware.
| If you still cannot trace out the problem then try resetting VLC Settings by the following procedure:
| If you can start VLC, go to **Tools** -> **Preferences** and then press **Reset Preferences**. **Save** to reset and save VLC settings.

Remember to restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

| 
| If you can't start VLC, go to **%appdata%** folder and delete **vlc** folder from there.
