== '''Introduction''' == The audio output of sound systems can be
improved using signal processing techniques which control the frequency
response, amplitude, and phase of the output signal. This project is in
two stages. In the first stage, the output of VLC media player will be
enhanced using similar concepts in other patented systems such as
SRS(sound retrieval system), in order to provide a better listening
experience.

The second stage involves creating an immersive audio experience, which
is a desirable feature in any sound reproduction system. This is
currently implemented in multichannel audio reproduction technologies
such as Dolby Prologic 2. These multichannel technologies typically
require multiple speakers in the equipment setup. The first project will
emulate the listening experience obtained from multichannel systems
using only a pair of speakers.

== '''Approach''' == The desired immersive audio synthesis will be
achieved using the head related transfer function (HRTF).
