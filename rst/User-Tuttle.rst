Hi there, my name is David Goldwich. I study computer science and philosophy at Free University of Berlin, but right now I'm in an exchange at University of California, Santa Cruz. In this year's Summer of Code I'll work on `improving the OMA demuxer <SoC_2011/OMA/Atrac_Improvements>`__.

Get in touch with me at firstname.lastname@gmail.com if you have any questions. You can also find me on Freenode as atuttle.
