Daala: https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/ \*\* Note that some of
the older demos do not match what is in Daala anymore. \*\* For more

= Practical information =

== Emergency situation == In case of emergency, call the European
emergency number '''112'''.

== Location / main venue == The venue is in Paris (France), 9th
district, near St Lazare:

Criteo<br/> 32 rue Blanche<br/> 75009 Paris, France

[https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Criteo/@48.878914,2.3315591,17z/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x47e66e04d509ec8f:0xbf35e94464e752f7!2sCriteo!3m1!1s0x47e66e04d509ec8f:0xbf35e94464e752f7
Google Maps]

== Accomodation / Hotel == For sponsored participants, the hotel is:

Timhotel Berthier Paris 17<br/> 4 Boulevard Berthier<br/> 75017 Paris,
France

http://www.timhotel-berthier-paris-17.com/\ <br/>
[https://www.google.fi/maps/place/Timhotel+Berthier+Paris+17/@48.894398,2.312611,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e66f9878ba126d:0x24a180f7131eebe5
Google Maps]

== Payment == The local currency is the Euro. Merchants are forbidden
from accepting other currencies (except exchange).

Most venues will accept EMV credit and debit cards (i.e. Chip & PIN), at
least VISA and MasterCard. Swipe-only cards can be more tricky (it has
been illegal for banks to issue them for years in France, so only
foreign visitors use them). American Express is widely but not
universally accepted. Diners/Discovery, UnionPay, JCB, etc. are mostly
only accepted in shops catering to tourists.

Best change rates are close to the Hotel, Metro Bourse, Vivienne Street.

== Transportation ==

-  Public transport:

=== Paris-CDG / Roissy airport ===

'''Important note:''' there are works on the RER B line at night until
Friday, included. The RER B service is interrupted between the airport
and the Aulnay-sous-Bois station at 11pm. There is a replacement bus
available but this incurs a much higher trip time. More information:
