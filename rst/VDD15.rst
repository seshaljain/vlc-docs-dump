-  take metro *Line 3* from **St Lazare** to **Havre-Caumartin** (1 stop only),
-  take the express train *RER A* to **Marne La Vallée-Chessy**

**N.B.:** You should buy a ticket to Marne La Vallée at the metro station. The ticket is valid for the entire journey.

Evening drinks

We will meet at a bar, in front of the hotel, for drinks (soft and beers), at around **20:30**.

Daala hackathon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open to anyone curious about Daala or video coding in general, we can help you write your first patch or teach you things!

To get started you can clone the Daala repository:

``git clone``\ ```https://github.com/xiph/daala.git`` <https://github.com/xiph/daala.git>`__

-  How to build and run Daala: https://wiki.xiph.org/Daala_Quickstart
-  Demonstrations and explanations of some of the techniques used in Daala: https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/

   -  Note that some of the older demos do not match what is in Daala anymore.
   -  For more details see https://wiki.xiph.org/Daala#Documents and https://wiki.xiph.org/Daala#Presentations

Practical information
=====================

Emergency situation
-------------------

In case of emergency, call the European emergency number **112**.

Location / main venue
---------------------

The venue is in Paris (France), 9th district, near St Lazare:

| Criteo
| 32 rue Blanche
| 75009 Paris, France

`Google Maps <https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Criteo/@48.878914,2.3315591,17z/data=!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x47e66e04d509ec8f:0xbf35e94464e752f7!2sCriteo!3m1!1s0x47e66e04d509ec8f:0xbf35e94464e752f7>`__

Accomodation / Hotel
--------------------

For sponsored participants, the hotel is:

| Timhotel Berthier Paris 17
| 4 Boulevard Berthier
| 75017 Paris, France

| http://www.timhotel-berthier-paris-17.com/
| `Google Maps <https://www.google.fi/maps/place/Timhotel+Berthier+Paris+17/@48.894398,2.312611,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e66f9878ba126d:0x24a180f7131eebe5>`__

Payment
-------

The local currency is the Euro. Merchants are forbidden from accepting other currencies (except exchange).

Most venues will accept EMV credit and debit cards (i.e. Chip & PIN), at least VISA and MasterCard. Swipe-only cards can be more tricky (it has been illegal for banks to issue them for years in France, so only foreign visitors use them). American Express is widely but not universally accepted. Diners/Discovery, UnionPay, JCB, etc. are mostly only accepted in shops catering to tourists.

Best change rates are close to the Hotel, Metro Bourse, Vivienne Street.

Transportation
--------------

-  Public transport: `RATP <http://www.ratp.fr/itineraires/en/ratp/recherche-avancee>`__
-  Attendees arrival & departure list: `VDD15/Attendees <VDD15/Attendees>`__

**NOTE**: VideoLAN does not refund taxi expenses nor car rentals.

**Important note:** there are works on the RER B line at night until Friday, included. The RER B service is interrupted between the airport and the Aulnay-sous-Bois station at 11pm.
