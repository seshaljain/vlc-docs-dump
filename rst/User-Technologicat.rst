My name is Juha Jeronen. Technically, I'm not an official VLC developer,
but I subscribe to vlc-devel.

I designed and programmed the IVTC and Phosphor deinterlacers for VLC
2.0 (which was then VLC 1.2), with help from fenrir for the MMX inline
assembly. I also refactored the deinterlacer module at that time.

I've updated the [[Deinterlacinghacker's guide for the deinterlacer]].
I've also written a [[Hacker_Guide/Video_Filters|hacker's guide for
VLC's video filters in general]].

As of 2012-01-27, I maintain VLC's Finnish translation.
