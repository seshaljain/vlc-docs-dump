I though that this was about "simple prefs". We don't need to replicate
the whole tree structure and include options which 99.9% of the users
don't use or understand. In my opinion, simple prefs should look like
firefox's preferences: several tabs/categories (less than 10) with about
5 to 20 options each. [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 15:02, 12 June 2006
(CEST) -- [[User:Pdherbemont]] strongly agrees

-  ffmpeg-hq ? -- Is this out of place? I can't find it in this context
   -- [[User:DJ]]. It's currently not in video, but codecs, but we are
   free to put whatever we want wherever. [[User:Zorglub]]. Isn't that
   going to get kinda confusing? [[User:DJ]]. Nope :) [[User:Zorglub]]
   Given that it's not in that context either and the only thing that's
   close is FFmpeg's -- "Post processing quality", I believe you have
   just proven my point. You maybe free to do what you want, but is it
   prudent and or wise, or can others understand it? :) -- [[User:DJ]]

I will agree with the basic premise, VLC needs a simple preferences
menu. But if you can't see the current tree of simple preferences as
they exist presently how can you have the discussion as to include them
or not? There also maybe a few that are not now in the simple
preferences that should be or a few that best be handled in a different
way or done away with entirely. But how can you see them to be able to
relate to them or know out of context? Plus the fact that you will never
be sure that you have reviewed them all and the new simple preferences
will go through several changes while the end user is still confused and
or ends up locking down the advanced options. -- [[User:DJ]] I disagree
we all work enough with VLC to know the preference menu almost by heart
and have VLC installed to check if needed (and that differ between OS
and build). Now, with every thing, how do you see which pref is to be
included in "the simple preferences" ?!? [[User:Xtophe|Xtophe]]
Considering you know it so well you should realize, only the simple
preferences are here. -- [[User:DJ]]

Perhaps going through the tree and marking everything that can't or
shouldn't be changed would make it easier to see and find things. --
[[User:DJ]]

I'm not trying to be presumptuous here, but if you can't see the current
representation of the simple preferences how can you know which ones to
include or exclude for an understandable discussion with a reasonable
end result? [[User:DJ]]

User Prefs for multiple instances of VLC playing different
streams---where is it? How do I activate it? I've checked forums and
docs but so far no luck...--[[User:DdanielsDdaniels]] 19:25, 23 January

Were hotkeys omitted voluntarily? [[User:Ipkiss]] :No, but we didn't
need to explain them. It will be a whole new category [[User:J-b|J-b]]

What about module specific options? For example, the wx-embed option can
be considered as a simple preference. [[User:Ipkiss]] : Module specific
options should be added. btw, some things have been commited and are not
on this page. Check it out[[User:J-b|J-b]] 09:31, 14 February 2007 (CET)
