=== My love of the VLC UI, is gone? === The first impression was
devastating for me going from 0.8.x to this 0.9.2, \* The dialogs, in
the Open-dialog I can't even type in samba-servers like \\172.16.0.10and
browse them - vlc will try to open "\172.16.0.10" as a FILE. \* Where
can I disable some of the things like - that interface down at the
bottom on fullscreen? Perhaps we want fullscreen right away when we
click fullscreen , I really would like an option \*\* I am putting the
y-value to -1000, perhaps it helps

Maybe I am just ranting for no good reason here at the wiki, should I
head out on a trac-system and shout loud there?

The UI of VLC has always been such a fan for a computer nerd like me,
speed, what I want, when I want it - these sort of things seems gone.
