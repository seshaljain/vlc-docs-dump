**Xiph Wiki** is a wiki of multimedia formats started by `Xiph <Xiph>`__. As VLC wiki concentrates on media formats which VLC can play, and on help for VLC, similarly Xiph wiki concentrates on Xiph technologies.

   "In an effort to bring open-source ideals to the world of multimedia the Xiph.org Foundation develops a multitude of amazing products. This wiki describes our free and open protocols and software." --Xiph Wiki
