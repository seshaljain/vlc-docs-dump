I don't know if this is the proper approach to solving my problem. If it
isn't -- would someone please point me in the right direction so that I
can solve my problem with VLC. I have used the VCL Media Player for
quite some time. Suddenly I could no longer get into it. I have
uninstalled then reinstalled this program. When choosing a media player
-- VLC Media Player appears as an option -- BUT, when I click on this
option -- NOTHING HAPPENS!

Is there a computer setting that I need to adjust?
