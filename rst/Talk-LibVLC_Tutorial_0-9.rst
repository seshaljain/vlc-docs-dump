This code doesn't appear to compile. I am using gcc 3.4. But some of the
problems are obvious, eg line 6, the parentheses don't match.

What version of libvlc was used to create the tutorial? Functions
`libvlc_media <>`__... don't appear to exist in the latest release
version, 0.8.6c. If an unreleased version is used for the tutorial, that
would be fine, if the text mentioned that.

The code wasn't tested, but should work using 0.9.0, or at least show
how to use.--[[User:Pdherbemont|Pdherbemont]] 22:36, 19 August 2007

Hi, How can i expose the function that handle with text displaying? This
is very important for every app that handle with user data on stream.

Thanks.
