This code doesn't appear to compile. I am using gcc 3.4. But some of the problems are obvious, eg line 6, the parentheses don't match.

What version of libvlc was used to create the tutorial? Functions libvlc_media_... don't appear to exist in the latest release version, 0.8.6c. If an unreleased version is used for the tutorial, that would be fine, if the text mentioned that.

The code wasn't tested, but should work using 0.9.0, or at least show how to use.--\ `Pdherbemont <User:Pdherbemont>`__ 22:36, 19 August 2007 (CEST)

Thanks.
