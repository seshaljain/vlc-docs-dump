| DivX stands for **Di**\ gital **V**\ ideo **X**\ treme. It is known as a `video codec <video_codec>`__ which has good `compression <compression>`__ ratios while preserving a good quality based on the `H.263 <H.263>`__ codec. It is `closed source <closed_source>`__.
| When DivX Inc. introduced the DivX6 format DivX became a container, too. The file extension for the DivX `container <container>`__ is .divx (*Still under development*) but normally the DivX `encoded <encode>`__ video will reside inside an `AVI <AVI>`__ container.

`XSUB <XSUB>`__ is the `subtitle <subtitle>`__ format for DivX 6.
