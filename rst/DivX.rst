DivX stands for '''Di'''gital '''V'''ideo '''X'''treme. It is known as a
[[video codec]] which has good [[compression]] ratios while preserving a
good quality based on the [[H.263]] codec. It is [[closed source]].<br
/> When DivX Inc. introduced the DivX6 format DivX became a container,
too. The file extension for the DivX [[container]] is .divx (''Still
under development'') but normally the DivX [[encode]]d video will reside
inside an [[AVI]] container.

[[XSUB]] is the [[subtitle]] format for DivX 6.
