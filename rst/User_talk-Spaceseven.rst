Hello Spaceseven, welcome to the VideoLAN Wiki!

Please feel free to edit the Wiki, to improve information about `VLC Media Player <VLC_Media_Player>`__. A good place to start may be the `Hardware Compatibility list <Hardware_Compatibility_list>`__: we are always looking for what hardware is compatible.

There are some `rules <rules>`__, but these are mainly common sense.

Happy editing! --`h2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 17:10, 4 November 2006 (CET)
