Deadline: 14/07/2006

Requirements for the website redesign are:

-  keep it simple
-  as someone famous once said, "dark designs should be forbiden from the web." We'll try to keep that in mind.
-  references to the cone ( `old VLC cone <http://www.videolan.org/images/cone-soppera10.png>`__ or `new VLC cone <http://trac.videolan.org/vlc/browser/trunk/share/vlc128x128.png>`__ ) or to the `VideoLAN logo <http://www.videolan.org/images/vl4_1024x768.jpg>`__ will be appreciated
-  change only the CSS plus *minimum* changes to the HTML code (fancy stuff with javascript isn't needed. If you beleive that javascript could enhance the website, make sure that it's still useable with javascript support turned off)
-  don't use a fixed width body
-  licensing for images/code needs to be GPL

Design concepts should provide mockups for at least these 3 pages: http://www.videolan.org/index.html , http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html and http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html .

Credit will be given to the wining design's author in the following places:

-  a news item will be published when the web design is changed
-  a link to the author's website can be added in the footer (we can't promise to keep it there for ever ... but it should stay there as long as the website it links to is up and its content isn't offensive)

The winner will be chosen by VideoLAN team members.

Discussions about the contest and design proposals should be posted in `the dedicated forum category <http://forum.videolan.org/viewforum.php?f=10>`__.
