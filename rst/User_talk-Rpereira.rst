== Error with...Leadtek Winfast Expert TV Card ==

[00000001] main libvlc error: option daemon does not exist

Thought it was maybe dbus, so i compiled a nondbus version but did not
help.

The card is a chipset

Conexant CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio

0000:01:06.0 Multimedia video controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878
Video Capture (rev 11)

and uses V4L2 which has now been incorporated into VLC.

Anyone have an idea about the issue?

=== How to find help ===

Hi,

You will probably not have answer on this wiki. You should try the
following: \* videolan IRC chat: server: ''irc.videolan.org'' channel
''[irc://irc.videolan.org#videolan #videolan]'' \*\* If you have no IRC
client and don't want to install one, [http://www.videolan.org/webirc/
web IRC client]s exists, some are userfriendly. \* videolan forum:
[http://forum.videolan.org forum.videolan.org] \* The
[http://www.videolan.org/support/lists.html mailing lists] also but IRC
and forum are more simple to get help.

regards,
