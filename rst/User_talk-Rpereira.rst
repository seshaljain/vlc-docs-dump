Error with...Leadtek Winfast Expert TV Card
-------------------------------------------

[00000001] main libvlc error: option daemon does not exist

Thought it was maybe dbus, so i compiled a nondbus version but did not help.

The card is a chipset

Conexant CX23880/1/2/3 PCI Video and Audio

0000:01:06.0 Multimedia video controller: Brooktree Corporation Bt878 Video Capture (rev 11)

and uses V4L2 which has now been incorporated into VLC.

Anyone have an idea about the issue?

How to find help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hi,

You will probably not have answer on this wiki. You should try the following:

-  videolan IRC chat: server: *irc.videolan.org* channel `#videolan <irc://irc.videolan.org#videolan>`__

   -  If you have no IRC client and don't want to install one, `web IRC client <http://www.videolan.org/webirc/>`__\ s exists, some are userfriendly.

-  videolan forum: `forum.videolan.org <http://forum.videolan.org>`__
-  The `mailing lists <http://www.videolan.org/support/lists.html>`__ also but IRC and forum are more simple to get help.

regards,
