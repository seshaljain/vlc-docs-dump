{{codec videoencoder=nmod=avcodec}} '''VP6''' is a video format created
by [[On2]], which is used in Flash (.swf) files since version 8.

== Compatibility ==

Some VP6 (VP62 and VP6F) are readable with the latest VLC stable release
(0.8.6).

VLC 0.9.0 should support VP61 and VP60. This is still under testing.
