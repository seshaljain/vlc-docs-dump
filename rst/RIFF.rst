{{wikipedia|Resource Interchange File Format}} '''RIFF''', the
'''Resource Interchange File Format''', is a format which stores data as
chunks. RIFF files may store audio in one chunk, video in another, and
meta information in a third. It uses [[FourCC]]s to distinguish between
different chunks and codecs.

RIFF files start with the magic id "RIFF". RIFF is the underlying format
for [[WAVE]] and [[AVI]] files.
