VLC for Mac â€“ Preparint the Graphical Interface for the Future
==============================================================

Abstract
--------

My Idea is it to take the Codebasis of VLC and Lunettes and put it all together. I pull the best out of both and take them to the next level. Missing features in both and a new Graphical Interface which will be suited for the feature for VLC and the Operating System.

Information
-----------

I go to the "Haute Ecole de la Province de Liege". I'm studying Computer Sience in Telecommunication and Network. From the 30th may till 20th of june i'm in exams and will not be able to work as much as wanted on the project.
