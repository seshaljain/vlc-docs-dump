ESA SOCIS Main Page
===================

Plans
-----

First of all x264 is profiled (this has been done and a link to the profiles are below)

| 

Profiles
~~~~~~~~

`X264 SOCIS/profiles <X264_SOCIS/profiles>`__

| 

Conversions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Functions that are normally C that are intended for asm will have NEON implementations by the end of the project Every DSP function will also have a NEON implementation

| 

List of functions to be implemented in NEON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timeline
--------

August 1st - 14th:           Learn ARM architecture and ARM assembly

August 15th - 21st:         Start learning NEON while writing NEON functions

August 22nd - Onwards:  Move onto harder functions\ *
*

Project end date:            28th October 2011

| 
| *List will be updated shortly*

Progress
--------

My progress to date:

-  Learned ARM assembly
