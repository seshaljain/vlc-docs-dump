{{wikipediaBit rate|Average bitrate}}

The '''bit rate''' or '''bitrate''' of media measures the bits used to
store the data per second (kilobits per second, kbit/s or kbps). It is
formally defined as the product of (bits per sample) × ([[sample
rate|samples per second]]).

A '''constant bit rate''' or '''constant bitrate''' (CBR) is a bit rate
that does not change.

A '''variable bit rate''' or '''variable bitrate''' (VBR) is a bit rate
that varies depending upon the complexity of the data.

An '''average bit rate''' or '''average bitrate''' (ABR) may refer to
either <code><var>total bits</var> &divide; <var>time</var></code> or
[https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Average_Bitrate a form of
VBR].

Some common bit rates for [[mp3]] files are 128 kbit/s (standard), 192
kbit/s (medium quality), 256 kbit/s (high quality) and 320 kbit/s
(highest quality).<br> A low bit rate (below about 128 kbps) makes for
poor audio quality.
