The **bit rate** or **bitrate** of media measures the bits used to store the data per second (kilobits per second, kbit/s or kbps). It is formally defined as the product of (bits per sample) ร (`samples per second <sample_rate>`__).

A **constant bit rate** or **constant bitrate** (CBR) is a bit rate that does not change.

A **variable bit rate** or **variable bitrate** (VBR) is a bit rate that varies depending upon the complexity of the data.

An **average bit rate** or **average bitrate** (ABR) may refer to either \ ``total bits``\ \ ``รท``\ \ ``time``\  or `a form of VBR <https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Average_Bitrate>`__.

| Some common bit rates for `mp3 <mp3>`__ files are 128 kbit/s (standard), 192 kbit/s (medium quality), 256 kbit/s (high quality) and 320 kbit/s (highest quality).
| A low bit rate (below about 128 kbps) makes for poor audio quality.
