There was no 1.2.x release (see [https://download.videolan.org/vlc/
release archive]); anything that claims to be 1.2.x refers to the
pre-release (see [https://download.videolan.org/testing/ testing
archive]) that was developed into 2.0.0. The 2.0.x images will probably
look identical to the pre-release images, but have [[:Category:VLC 2.0.x
images|a separate category]].
