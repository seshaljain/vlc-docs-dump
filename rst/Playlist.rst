Playlists are files that contain information on which files to play.
Usually they are plain text files with paths to the files to play. Here
an example in the [[M3U]] format:

   rock.mp3 classical.mp3 OTHERnew.mp3 \\COMPUTERNAMEMusicBandArtistname
   - Track - Title of the Song.mp3 <nowiki>http://www.webaddress.
   com/.../movie clip.mp4</nowiki>
   <nowiki>http://111.22.333.44:8024\ </nowiki>

This file would instruct the player to first play the file rock.mp3,
then classical.mp3 and then the file new.mp3 which is in the directory
OTHER before accessing a song on the local network. Then it plays a
movie clip in [[MP4]] format from the web and lastly switches to a [[web
radio]] station.
