Playlists are files that contain information on which files to play. Usually they are plain text files with paths to the files to play. Here an example in the `M3U <M3U>`__ format:

| ``rock.mp3``
| ``classical.mp3``
| ``OTHER\new.mp3``
| ``\\COMPUTERNAME\Music\Band\Artistname - Track - Title of the Song.mp3``
| `` http://www.webaddress. com/.../movie clip.mp4``
| `` http://111.22.333.44:8024``

This file would instruct the player to first play the file rock.mp3, then classical.mp3 and then the file new.mp3 which is in the directory OTHER before accessing a song on the local network. Then it plays a movie clip in `MP4 <MP4>`__ format from the web and lastly switches to a `web radio <web_radio>`__ station.
