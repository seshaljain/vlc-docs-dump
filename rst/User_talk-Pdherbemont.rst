Editing in the documentation namespace
--------------------------------------

Pierre, Please read `Documentation:EditingGuidelines <Documentation:EditingGuidelines>`__. Specifically: the documentation shouldn't link outside of the documentation. I guess that you could just move the pages arround. `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 16:04, 1 February 2008 (CET)

VLC OS X
--------

It looks to me like you're at least working on the OS X version of VLC, and thus may at least know who else I should talk to about this.

I was wondering if you guys had specifically decided not to use the Sparkle framework for updating the app for some reason. If that's not the case, I would be interested in seeing about adding the Sparkle framework to the program, and was wondering who I should talk to to go about starting doing that.

Anyways, let me know if I should talk to someone else about it, or how I should go about doing this. Thanks! `Alpha dk <User:Alpha_dk>`__ 02:18, 30 September 2008 (CEST)

We are effectively interested in using the Sparkle framework (at least two of us). Though I don't think we have the time/will to do it.
