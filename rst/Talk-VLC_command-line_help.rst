mp3 metadata transcoding VLC? How to add metadata to mp3 stream? Also
where this COMMAND LINE in VLC - I dodn't find it?

: I don't think you can change the metadata directly on VLC at the
moment, sorry about that :( : The command line is cmd.exe

== Appearance of this Wiki page ==

This page is very long and wide, and since the included scroll bar is
out of sight at the bottom, it's hard to navigate. Running Firefox and
searching for the word "equalizer", there were apparently a few
occurrences of it that were utterly invisible.

this page renders my os x browser unusable. I also can't see any of the
text in the {code} section

== Explanation of ISO639 codes ==

In the following two command options ...
   --audio-language=<string> --sub-language=<string>

... the help indicates that you can use a 2- or 3-letter ISO639 code.
This is true, but there is also a special code, "any" (all lowercase),
that defaults to using any language. If you omit "any", the system
defaults to "Disabled". --[[User:Johnf|Johnf]] 04:32, 30 August 2009

== We should only keep the first few lines of this page ==

This page is not very useful as the information it contains can easily
be generated using "vlc --help". What do you think?
