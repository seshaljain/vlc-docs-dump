I am placing myself in the position of a developer writing a complete
client for Rhythmbox which should implement this interface. I think
there are two missing functionalities: \* How do I save/load a
tracklist? In Rhythmbox, the playlist are saved in one xml file
transparent to the user but in beep-media-player, they are save as .pls
if I'm not mistaken. The mechanism should take that into consideration.
\* Is there away to filter the tracklist? For example, if I want to list
all the tracks for a particular album, how could I do this? BTW, this is
a great idea, I'll hope to be able to use it in a upcoming project soon!
