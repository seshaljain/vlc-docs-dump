I am placing myself in the position of a developer writing a complete client for Rhythmbox which should implement this interface. I think there are two missing functionalities:

-  How do I save/load a tracklist? In Rhythmbox, the playlist are saved in one xml file transparent to the user but in beep-media-player, they are save as .pls if I'm not mistaken. The mechanism should take that into consideration.
-  Is there away to filter the tracklist? For example, if I want to list all the tracks for a particular album, how could I do this?

BTW, this is a great idea, I'll hope to be able to use it in a upcoming project soon!
