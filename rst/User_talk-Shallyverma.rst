   HI I have a question on VideoLAN when it stream content from file.
   Does it support forward and reverse operation on content and then
   stream it to client? For ex. I have setup VLC to stream MPEG file to
   my client which receives it, decode and display it. and I want to
   play the content in fast forward fashion, then i can set up VLS to do
   forward operation and send selected content to client so that it can
   be played in fast forward mode?

:Hi Shallyverma - you'll get an answer if you ask over at the
[http://forum.videolan.org/ VideoLAN forum]. This wiki isn't really a
support wiki, it's more of a documentation wiki.
