I have written my own PVR software in C++/Tcl. Today it uses an old version of Media Player for playback. That version doesn't support some newer video formats, like mp4, dvr-ms, ts. So I want to use libvlc.dll instead. I had some trouble with the libvlc tutorial pages, so I added my recent experience.
