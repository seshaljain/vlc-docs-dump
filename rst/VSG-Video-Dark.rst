Videos are too dark
-------------------

| Often this is caused by video hardware overlay problems:
| If it is only one video then use the "Settings" menu, option "Extended GUI" and try to increase the Gamma value in the "Video" tab.

| 
| Check your video card settings and turn off hardware video overlay.

| If the videos now play with proper lighting, then deinstalling and reinstalling the video drivers might help.
