About me
--------

Hello, I'm a French developer and I'm also a newbie. I'm currently studying in third year of computing license. I went on the 19th Saturday of October at the "Journée Du Logiciel Libre" in Lyon, so I have decided to help a free software.

I have some knowledges of C and C++. In order to improve myself and improve VLC, I have decided to try helping the VLC project.

Suggestions
-----------

-  Portage of VLC current version in aptitude packet manager (The last version of VLC in aptitude is 0.8.6.).
-  Please, give me some task I can do ^^.
