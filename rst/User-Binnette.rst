==About me==

Hello, I'm a French developer and I'm also a newbie. I'm currently
studying in third year of computing license. I went on the 19th Saturday
of October at the "Journ√©e Du Logiciel Libre" in Lyon, so I have decided
to help a free software.

I have some knowledges of C and C++. In order to improve myself and
improve VLC, I have decided to try helping the VLC project.

==Suggestions== \* Portage of VLC current version in aptitude packet
manager (The last version of VLC in aptitude is 0.8.6.). \* Please, give
me some task I can do ^^.

==Important links== \* [[Help VideoLAN]] \* [[Mini Projects]] \* [[Git]]
