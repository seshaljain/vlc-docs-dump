== The Window menu ==

[[Image:Vlcwindow_osx.png]]

This menu gives you access to all the different types of interface
windows that are available.

:\* '''Minimize Window''' will make the active interface window
'disappear' to the OS X dock, :\* '''Close Window''' will close the
active interface window, :\* '''Main Window''' some text, :\*
'''Playlist''' will open the playlist section of the controller window,
or if it is closed then the next time the controller window opens then
the playlist section will be opened, each time you 'Open' a file it is
supposed to be appended to this playlist, :\* '''Media Information'''
will be 'greyed-out' unless vlc has an input stream selected, if there
is an input stream selected then it will open a window giving detailled
information on stream meta-data, stream components and streaming
performance statistics, :\* '''Video Filters''' some text, :\* '''Audio
Effects''' some text, :\* '''Track Synchronization''' some text, :\*
'''Bookmarks''' this opens a window which allows the addition, editing
and deletion of bookmarks related to the currently selected stream, I
have the impression that these bookmarks are remembered by vlc, :\*
'''Errors and Warnings''' some text, :\* '''Messages''' displays the
console messages output by vlc, probably only useful for debugging, :\*
'''Bring All to Front''' some text
