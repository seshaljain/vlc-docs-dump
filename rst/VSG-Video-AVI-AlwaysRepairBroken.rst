Always perform repair action for broken AVI Files
-------------------------------------------------

This can be done from **Tools -> Preferences** (set **Show Settings** to\ **All**) and\ **Input / Codecs -> Demuxers -> AVI**.

Select the wanted action from **Force index creation** dropdown box. Ask is default (it will always ask what you want to do).

**Always fix** tries to always fix AVI files and **Never fix** always starts the playback without fixing.

| 
| Remember to press **Save** to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.
