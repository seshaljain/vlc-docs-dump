Update Button/Down Arrows
-------------------------

Where will the update button be placed in the interface? What function will he accomplish exactly? Same questions about the down arrows in playlist and open dialog. --`Altglass <User:Altglass>`__ 16:43, 19 April 2008 (CEST)

   Update is a button I use now to force synchronisation between the state in the core and in the interface in extended dialog/synchronisation. Down arrow is used for a button that has a drop-down menu for more options. `jb <User:J-b>`__

Note on my proposals: Colors can be modified to your preference. --`Altglass <User:Altglass>`__ 16:43, 19 April 2008 (CEST)

Reaction on the proposal
------------------------

I like the black eject, the black extended and the black and white playlist. DVD next, prev, menu too.

However, on all of those, the borders are too wide. see `playlist.png <http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=blob;f=modules/gui/qt4/pixmaps/playlist.png>`__ for reference on that.

Fullscreen is too confusing,

A->B(I like the last one the best), snapshots are good, but we may need more than one for AtoB...

About the play button, I don't know yet, but I kind of like the idea of MPRIS http://wiki.xmms2.xmms.se/index.php/MPRIS

      The borders are 1px wide, so physically seen I can't get any smaller. I could although reduce the size of some icons .
      Comparison:

      DVD actions are already quite small, excepts the menu icon #1. What do you think?

      Concerning the MPRIS play button. Do you like the blue color, or what do you specifically like about it?
