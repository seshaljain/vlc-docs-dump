Its looks like the linked file
"[http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=history;f=modules/demux/dts.c
modules/demux/dts.c] (input demuxer)" have been removed during September
2008.

[http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=blob;f=modules/audio_filter/converter/dtstofloat32.c;hb=HEAD
modules/audio_filter/converter/dtstofloat32.c] is still there, should it
be linked instead? --[[User:Thannoy|Thannoy]] 23:40, 7 December 2008
