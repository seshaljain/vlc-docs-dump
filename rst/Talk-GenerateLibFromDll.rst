== Page name ==

The name of this page is not so good. At least it do not conform to
other page names in which we use spaces. Here are some rename proposals:
\* generate lib from dll \* generate a libvlc.lib

NB: spaces in page names are converted to underscores (_) for their URL.
This is my opinion, what are your ideas? --[[User:Thannoy|Thannoy]]
