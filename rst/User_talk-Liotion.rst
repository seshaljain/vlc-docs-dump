I need your help!

There are something wrong when is use VLC 0.8.6c player to play mp4
files on Darwin 5.5.6 streaming server(BTW:the mp4 file is coded by
ffmpeg using mp4 format and it had hint track.)

1. when i drag the progess bar, it will jump forward and jump back after
   a little while.
2. Sometimes, when it players as usual, the image stops while the
   progress bar is still going on, and sometimes both the image and the
   progress bar stop!

eager for your answer!
