{{See alsol1=MPEG-2 &sect; Container formats (TS and PS)}}
{{wikipedia|Comparison of container formats}} This lists
'''[[container]]s''', also known as ''media file formats''.

Containers are Files that can contain audio and/or video. The audio and
video is encoded (compressed) using [[codecs]], and then stored in a
container. Codecs can normally be used in a variety of different
containers.

You can usually tell what container format is used for a file by looking
at the file's extension. For example, if a file has a .mp4 extension, it
is likely to contain [[MPEG-4]] video.

Below are listed the formats you can play with vlc (if I've missed any,
feel free to add it :-)
