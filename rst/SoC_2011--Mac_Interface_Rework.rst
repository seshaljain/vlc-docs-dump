Mac OS X Interface Rework
=========================

Abstract
--------

The Mac OS X interface is in a bad shape for quite some time. Now it's time to rework it, to embed the video output within the playlist window and to add the missing features from the Qt4 interface. This is what I'll do. The UI design will be based upon drafts by Damien Erambert (for mockups, `click here <https://www.dropbox.com/gallery/14924522/1/gsoc-redesign?h=d702d6>`__).
