== Wiki syntax ==

Hi and thanks for contributing on this wiki. As you will see I fixed you
recently created page named [[Stream VLC to Website with asf and
Flash]].

Here are some tips for you to fix it deeper if you want: \* title
syntax, simple: \*\* '''==''' title '''==''' and \*\* '''===''' subtitle
'''===''' \* link to pages in this same wiki. <nowiki>[[page
name]]</nowiki> or <nowiki>[[page name|link text]]</nowiki> \* one-line
pieces of code can be more readable if the line start with a space.
