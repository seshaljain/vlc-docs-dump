Wiki syntax
-----------

Hi and thanks for contributing on this wiki. As you will see I fixed you recently created page named `Stream VLC to Website with asf and Flash <Stream_VLC_to_Website_with_asf_and_Flash>`__.

Here are some tips for you to fix it deeper if you want:

-  title syntax, simple:

   -  **==** title **==** and
   -  **===** subtitle **===**

-  link to pages in this same wiki. [[page name]] or [[page name|link text]]
-  one-line pieces of code can be more readable if the line start with a space.
