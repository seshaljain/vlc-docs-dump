Hi,

i read your site with much hope to solve the dvd-region problem on my
power book G4. as long as it has a Matshita DVD-R UJ-835E i tried the
vlc-player as recommended at your side. but it did not work! i can start
the dvd but can't go further to start the movie/can not use the
interactive buttoms as usual. when i try i always get the following
messages: main picture to date 0x21a5a3c has invalid status 6 main
picture display 0x21a5a3c has invalid status 6 picture 0x21a5a3c
refcount is - 1

and after that, access file error:
   "access_file: read failed (permisson denied)"

crash log is empty

what to do?????????????

thanks to everybody
