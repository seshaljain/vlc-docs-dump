We already have the exact same info in the NEWS file. This wiki page would be helpful if it gave more detail about the different features. If it's just copy & paste, I'm not sure that it's worth it. `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 10:45, 19 April 2007 (CEST)

   First, the main need was a link to the specific changes for 0.8.6b, which is not possible with the NEW txt file; moreover, this file starts with the changes for 0.9.0-svn so that one has to scroll far down to actually find the 0.8.6b changes. (to be compared to this `direct link <Release_changes#Changes_between_0.8.6a_and_0.8.6b>`__)
   However, if you propose a better idea, that would be great.
   Second, as you said, this page can be "wiki-enhanced" to add information to the changes - like: "\* added support for `blah blah <blah_blah>`__ codec", and so on...
