| Below are a summary of the permissions of both standard users and administrators.

   {{wikipedia|Wikipedia:Administrators}}

**Regular users** are able to:

-  create pages
-  edit pages
-  rename pages
-  clean up vandalism
-  report other problems concerning the wiki to [ administrators listed here]

**Administrators** are able to perform these actions as well as:

-  edit otherwise restricted pages
-  delete pages

   -  view or restore pages from the 'deleted pages' hidden archive

-  combat vandalism

   -  quickly undo the most recent edits a single user has made to any page
   -  protect or un-protect pages depending on how often they are targeted for vandalism
   -  block users that vandalise repeatedly
   -  take further actions to combat spam and vandalism

| At first glance this would appear to be an unfair distribution of power, but it's just the `Principle of least privilege <Wikipedia:Principle_of_least_privilege>`__. Regular users are allowed to clean up vandalism and thereby protect the wiki, but administrators often concern themselves with dealing with spammers, abusive editors, and technical matters.
| Administrators still have to follow the rules of the community.
