Administrators (also called "admins" or "sysops") are users of this wiki
entrusted with powerful tools to help run the site.<br /> Below are a
summary of the permissions of both standard users and administrators.

{{wikipedia|Wikipedia:Administrators}}

'''Regular users''' are able to: \* create pages \* edit pages \* rename
pages \* clean up vandalism \* report other problems concerning the wiki
to <span class="plainlinks">[{{fullurl:Special:ListUsers|group=sysop}}
administrators listed here]</span>

'''Administrators''' are able to perform these actions as well as: \*
edit otherwise restricted pages \* delete pages \*\* view or restore
pages from the 'deleted pages' hidden archive \* combat vandalism \*\*
quickly undo the most recent edits a single user has made to any page
\*\* protect or un-protect pages depending on how often they are
targeted for vandalism \*\* block users that vandalise repeatedly \*\*
take further actions to combat spam and vandalism

At first glance this would appear to be an unfair distribution of power,
but it's just the [[Wikipedia:Principle of least privilege|Principle of
least privilege]]. Regular users are allowed to clean up vandalism and
thereby protect the wiki, but administrators often concern themselves
with dealing with spammers, abusive editors, and technical matters.<br
/> Administrators still have to follow the rules of the community.
