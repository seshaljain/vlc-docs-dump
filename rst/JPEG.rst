JPEG (or JPG) is an acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group
[image]. It is a [[lossy]] image type that has the advantage of being
very small in size. It does this by approximating colour in a way that
the human eye cannot detect. Because early systems could not store the
full last four characters as an extension it has historically had the
filename extension .JPG on DOS systems and JPG remains a common
abbreviation.
