I am interested in working on the DVB support for Windows project. I
have an ATI video capture card in my Windows PC. Is this the type of
hardware I would need to work on the project?

--------------

'''Quovodis''': no, you need a DVB capture card, typically manufactured
by Hauppagge, Technotrend, Twinhan, etc... as far as I know all the ATI
capture cards are analog only (Tuner, Composite, S-video)

--------------

I would be willing to help with the DVB support. I have a Hauppauge
Nova-T (DVB-T) on a Windows box. I also have loads of free time and some
C++ experience, so just tell me where to start.

--------------

I would be willing to do DirectX 9 integration if you can send me the
specifics. I have good C++ experience and some older DirectDraw
experience but I can learn and I do image medical processing for a
living.

Hiya. I'm a little unsure about the protocol in these circumstances, as
I've never contributed to an opensource project before. That said, I
would quite like to contribute something back to this project. I have a
fair bit of personal DirectX experience, and a some medium (2 yrs
professional) C++ experience. If nobody else is actually working on the
DX mini project I would be happy to take it on.

---Hi, I have a Freecom DVB-T USB card which has DBA drivers. I'm not
C(anything) coder but I'm happy to help in any way I can. I'm familiar
with DVB issues etc. and work in commercial software testing so I can at
least do some testing of the code you guys produce. ----
