{{xiph|CMML}} {{Historical}}

'''CMML''' is a way of storing meta information about a file. This
information can change as the file is played. It is used with [[Ogg]]
media files.

It can be used for [[subtitles]].

Support for CMML was removed in {{VLC}} 1.1.0 and upwards.

Xiph wiki warns that CMML is deprecated and recommends [[OggKate]]
instead (as of [https://wiki.xiph.org/index.php?title=CMML&oldid=12990
August 2011]).
