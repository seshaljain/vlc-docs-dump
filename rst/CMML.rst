**CMML** is a way of storing meta information about a file. This information can change as the file is played. It is used with `Ogg <Ogg>`__ media files.

It can be used for `subtitles <subtitles>`__.

Support for CMML was removed in 1.1.0 and upwards.

Xiph wiki warns that CMML is deprecated and recommends `OggKate <OggKate>`__ instead (as of `August 2011 <https://wiki.xiph.org/index.php?title=CMML&oldid=12990>`__).
