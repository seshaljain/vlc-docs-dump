Am i here by mistake?? I don't know! Sorry! Is there anyone out there?? Can you help please! I've now spent too many hours trying to find an answer... I don't know what section i'm in, i don't know how this all works...I don't know much!! I'm exhausted! Can someone out there get me to the right place/ person??!! I'm just trying to record clips of home movie/lecture DVDs i've made. Need them yesterday!! It always worked before. I LOVE VLC media player!

But Suddenly, EVERY clip of video I record on my Windows Vista HP pc (using vlc) first flashes a photo of an album cover/song photo from a song I downloaded for a little girl [CALL ME, MAYBE! ugh!] some time ago.

AND, when I try to COPY a section of any video, the playback does ALL the audio first, and then the video!! NEVER TOGETHER SYNCED! THE SHORT CUT SYNC KEYS DON'T EVEN BEGIN TO REMEDY THIS!

I uninstalled VLC EVERYTHING, cleared cache, preferences, etc.....to the best of my understanding. Reinstalled latest version 2 times... BUT NOTHING CHANGED!! Who can i ask?? thank you! Johanna 123johb@gmail.com
