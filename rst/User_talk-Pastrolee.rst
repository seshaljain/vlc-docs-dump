== how can i watch a movie online with videolan ==

The wiki is a documentation reference. For question, you should go to
the forum.v.o In short, you need to install the [[ActiveX]] or the
[[Documentation:Play_HowTo/Advanced_Use_of_VLC#Use_the_mozilla_plugin|Mozilla
Plugin]] and use a website which is designed to serve a video using
VLCweb plugins.
