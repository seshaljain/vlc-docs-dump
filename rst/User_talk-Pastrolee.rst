The wiki is a documentation reference. For question, you should go to the forum.v.o In short, you need to install the `ActiveX <ActiveX>`__ or the `Mozilla Plugin <Documentation:Play_HowTo/Advanced_Use_of_VLC#Use_the_mozilla_plugin>`__ and use a website which is designed to serve a video using VLCweb plugins.
