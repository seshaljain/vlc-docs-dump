== Dragging and dropping subtitles disables pause ==

This was a known issue in old versions of {{VLC}}. It is fixed in
releases after 2.0.0.

The other solution is to either open subtitles from '''Use a subtitles
file''' when you open file you want to watch or trust the '''Autodetect
subtitle files''' function and name the subtitles in same as the movie
(for example, '''my_movie.avi''' and '''my_movie.srt''').
