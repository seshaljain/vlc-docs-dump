Enlightened Sound Daemon (also known as EsounD and ESD) was one of the
original audio output modules for Linux included since VLC's infancy.
{{docmod|arts}} and the esd plugin were removed prior to VLC 1.0.0,
because both projects were inactive.

Modern Linux users can use the {{docmodjack}} modules instead. There are
probably others.
