This is [[User:Zephyrxero|Derick Eisenhardt's]] concept for how VLC
0.9's new interface should look.

I think there are a few slight changes that would help VLC look better
and be more usable. What I have done here is simply move around the
buttons a bit, and made a quick and dirty mock-up for layout's sake. I
can make a pretty version of it later if you guys like this button
layout.

*Play/pause has been moved to the far left and enlarged because it is
the most commonly used button*\ Playlist button has been moved to the
far right for easy access *FastForward and Rewind Buttons have been
moved to the sides of the progress bar*\ The volume bar and mute button
are also now right justified

*All buttons (besides the standard File/Main Menu) have been moved to
reside below the video portion*\ A fullscreen button has been added
right after the new position of the eject button **do note there is a
spacer on both sides of the eject button**\ the fullscreen button can
either be "grey'd out" or completely removed when there is no video *The
text box with the current play speed has been removed to save space and
can easily be replaced with an icon overlayed on top of video just as
you would see when pressing pause*\ Also in the text box I think it
would be great (if possible) to have the media file's title scroll when
too long to fit into the box (ala WinAmp and XMMS).

Modification idea for this concept (video only) (by [[User:atomas|Thomas
Seifried]]):

\* Move the full screen button to the upper right side (into the menu).
So its near to the maximize button. \* Insert a audio and subtitle
stream switcher (drop down boxes) in the empty space between file open
and volume control \* Another idea would be to have a drop down box on
the forward / backward buttons, that opens the navigation in chapters
(if someone holds the button for some time)
