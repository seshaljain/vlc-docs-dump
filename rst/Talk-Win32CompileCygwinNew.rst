== ranlib command added ==

I added this because in the
contrib-20090121-win32-bin-gcc-3.4.5-only.tar.bz2 tarball one library
(liblua.a) needed this ranlib. In anycase it doesn't hurt to do it! --

== Windows bz2 contrib ==

Note related to section "Installing the Win32 "contrib" package in
Cygwin"

To uncompress a bz2 archive, isn't 'j' option needed by tar? Like this:
tar xjf
contrib-20080702-win32-bin-gcc-4.2.1-sjlj-runtime-3.13-only.tar.bz2 -C /
