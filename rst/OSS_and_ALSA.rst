'''OSS''' or '''Open Sound System''' is a framework for audio on
[[GNU/Linux]] and \*BSD systems. The GNU/Linux community eschewed OSS
after improvements to the code were made [[proprietary]], though these
were eventually re-released [[open source]].<br /> OSSv4 is still used
on [[FreeBSD]] and miscellaneous GNU/Linux distros.

'''ALSA''' or '''Advanced Linux Sound Architecture''' is the more
powerful replacement framework. It is not itself a sound server like
PulseAudio, it is just the Linux kernel code for handling sound as an
{{API}}. [[PulseAudio]] and [[JACK]] are built on ALSA.

{{VLC}} supports both as separate modules: {{docmodalsa}}.
