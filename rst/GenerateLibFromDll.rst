== Introduction ==

To avoid installing and fighting against MSYS and Cygwin, you can just
extract exported symbols from libvlc.dll to generate a .lib (libvlc.lib)
and link your program against it. And all of this using only with
Microsoft Visual Studio Tools!

In case you don't have Visual Studio you can download the free version
here [http://www.microsoft.com/express/download Visual Studio Express].

== Open a Command Prompt ==

It can be found within the Visual Studio Tools menu entry: Start /
Program Files / Microsoft Visual Studio / Visual Studio Tools / Visual
Studio Command Prompt.

== Extract Symbols ==

Within the command prompt type:

   {{promptwindowsq=n}}libvlc.dll" &gt; "{{Path to
   VLCdir=y|q=n}}libvlc.def"

Edit the libvlc.def file and modify it to get something like this:
   EXPORTS libvlc_add_intf libvlc_audio_get_channel
   libvlc_audio_get_mute libvlc_audio_get_track
   libvlc_audio_get_track_count libvlc_audio_get_track_description
   libvlc_audio_get_volume ...

Alternatively, the following command will automatically generate the DEF
file:

   {{promptcmd}} for /f "usebackq tokens=4,\* delims=\_ " %i in (dumpbin
   /exports "{{Path to VLC|windows|dir=y|q=n}}libvlc.dll") do if
   %i==libvlc echo %i_%j >> libvlc.def

== Generate the .lib ==

Still within the command prompt type:

   {{promptwindowsq=n}}libvlc.def" /out:"{{Path to
   VLCdir=y|q=n}}libvlc.lib" /machine:x86

Of course, you'll need to adapt the path according to your
configuration.

Voil√†! You have it, now you can link against libvlc.lib in your program
