VLC has a nice supplement, which allows you to personalise your VLC
player. All You have to do is to visit
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/skins.php and find the skin you like most.

Download the file and and put it into a VLC installation directory. Then
go to your VLC setting and change your interface to your downloaded
skin. Restart your VLC player and you have your cool skin. <br>

Go to Tools -&gt; Preferences... (set Show Settings to All) andInterface
-&gt; Main interfaces and from Interface module dropdown box select
Skinnable Interface. Remember to press Save to save VLC settings and
restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled. Image about
