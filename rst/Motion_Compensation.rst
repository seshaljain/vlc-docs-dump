{{wikipedia|Motion Compensation}} Part of the video compression process.
New [[frame]]s normally store changes in the image since the previous
frame. If the scene is moving as a whole (such as panning), motion
compensation moves the reference frame to line up with the new frame.
This means that there are less changes to be stored since the previous
frame, and so less data needs to be stored.
