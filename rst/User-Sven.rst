Hello

I've just seen too many spam on this wiki and I've got bored so I decided to register and remove it.

What to do against spam? Maybe you could write an *anti-bot-widget*, that's something where the visitor has to enter a (for bots) hardly readable code (sorry I've forgotten the name of these things && sorry for my horrible english ``:)``).

Another idea: Count the links on a submitted page or check if the user has entered words like *sex*,\ *nokia*,etc.

Another idea: Just let the user log in after.... I don't know, a mail, two mails, three mails ;-)

Sven

PS: vlc is great :)
