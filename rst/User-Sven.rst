<div style="border: 1px solid #aaa; background-color: #fefefe; padding:
2em; margin: 2em;"> Hello

I've just seen too many spam on this wiki and I've got bored so I
decided to register and remove it.

What to do against spam? Maybe you could write an ''anti-bot-widget'',
that's something where the visitor has to enter a (for bots) hardly
readable code (sorry I've forgotten the name of these things && sorry
for my horrible english <code>:)</code>).

Another idea: Count the links on a submitted page or check if the user
has entered words like ''sex'',''nokia'',etc.

Another idea: Just let the user log in after.... I don't know, a mail,
two mails, three mails ;-)

PS: vlc is great :) </div>
