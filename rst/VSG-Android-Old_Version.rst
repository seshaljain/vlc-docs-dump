== VLC doesn't work with Android 2.0 or lower == VLC for Android only
supports phones that run Android 2.1 or higher. VLC is not supported for
these versions of Android and will never be.

Try to obtain a newer device that runs Android 2.1 or higher, or attempt
to upgrade the firmware on your device.
