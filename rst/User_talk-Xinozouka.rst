Hello,

I just want to make a suggestion above VLC.

I am not sure if this is the place to ask by anyway, anyway here it
goes.

My suggestion is: as every day more and more people is starting to see
movies in V.O. (original version) with subtitles.

Will be useful to create an application or complement that help to the
user to translate any word that appears on the subtitle.

The complement could be similar to the current google translation bar,
which only with approach the arrow mouse above the word we have the
translation inmediatly.

Could be this possible?

Thank you very much

Sinceretly

David
