Do we need this page (and it's links)? Direct links to wikipedia would be better in my opinion. If needed, perhaps a single compatibility / incompatibility page for hardware / software could be created. The special case here is `Anevia <Anevia>`__ - we should probably link to them from somewhere. Also, `Servers <Servers>`__ could probably have the same treatment --`H2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 01:50, 17 January 2006 (CET)
