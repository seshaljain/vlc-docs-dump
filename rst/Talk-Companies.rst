Do we need this page (and it's links)? Direct links to wikipedia would
be better in my opinion. If needed, perhaps a single compatibility /
incompatibility page for hardware / software could be created. The
special case here is [[Anevia]] - we should probably link to them from
somewhere. Also, [[Servers]] could probably have the same treatment
