You can use **Tools -> Preferences...** (set Show Settings to All) and **Interface** and select correct language from **Language** drop down list. Remember to press **Save** to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

Also you can use\ **--language=** from command line if you can't navigate with current language or you want to use batch files/scripts. for example: **vlc --language=en** to get English. Other options are auto, en, ar, pt_BR, en_GB, ca, zh_TW, cs, da, nl, fi, fr, gl, ka, de, he, hu, it, ja, ko, ms, oc, fa, pl, pt_PT, ro, ru, zh_CN, sr, sk, sl, es, sv, tr
