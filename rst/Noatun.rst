**Noatun** is the default `media player <media_player>`__ in KDE, the desktop for `linux <linux>`__.

Compatibility
-------------

Noatun can play most media files, but does not allow streamed content.

Noatun uses `aRts <aRts>`__ to play music. aRts will keep running and have exclusive use of the sound device, even if you quit noatun. It's quite safe to kill aRts so that vlc can use the sound card:

``pkill -x artsd``

`Category:Player <Category:Player>`__ `Category:Proposed deletion <Category:Proposed_deletion>`__
