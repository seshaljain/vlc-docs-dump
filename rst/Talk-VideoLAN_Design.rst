==Wiki vs. Doc pages== I've been messing with the http interface and
noticed quite a variation in the information available from the
videolan/doc/ area compared to wiki.videolan.org. Is there a migration
progress likely? This discussion page seems as good as any to find out
about the plans for the wiki, although I'm not sure why the talk page
was previously deleted. Anyway, the wiki seems much more comprehensive
and up to date - some of the http interface info in the wiki is
scattered across several articles, but that's easily fixable. Look
forward to updating it, if that's going to be useful.
