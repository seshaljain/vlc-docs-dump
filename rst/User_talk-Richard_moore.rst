Vlc is very complicated for a novice like me. But I heard it was the
best & I want the best. Having a lot of difficulty putting into
operation. Also every movie I want to view on various sites won't unless
I download their player. Should I have to download every movie sites
player? Am I doing something wrong? Sorry I'm not very good on
computers. Just want to watch some movies for free. :Hi. I don't know
how to solve your problem, but if it's still an issue you might want to
consider asking in the [http://forum.videolan.org/ support forum]. Sorry
I didn't see this until now. {{User:DoesItReallyMatter/real_sig}} 14:06,
