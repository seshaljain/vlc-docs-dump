== '''General Presentation''' == Hello everybody.

My name is '''Aurélien DROCHON'''. I'm a student of ISTIA at University
of Angers in France ([http://www.istia.univ-angers.fr ISTIA]).

For my study, I have a project to do and this project,called Recording,
is in collaboration with the society Actech (Cybervia) including with
the members of this site like [http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Thannoy
Thannoy], [http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Remiii Remiii] and an other
student of my school [http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Mathieu_istia
Mathieu_istia].

I begin in development on VLC, so I risk to have some questions and I
hope you help me. Thank you.

See you.
