'''RTSP''' or '''Real Time Streaming Protocol''' is a [[protocol]] that
governs the [[stream]]ing aspects of the connection established with
[[RTP]]. VLC supports RTSP through the [[LiveMedia]] library.

RTSP version 1.0 was published in April 1998 and is considered obsolete
by the {{IETF}}; version 2.0 was published in December 2016 and remains
a Proposed Standard.
