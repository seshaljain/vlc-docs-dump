My name is Philipp Weissenbacher, I'm a third semester cs student at the University of Vienna. My primary field of interest is HCI and i18n and to a lesser extent more technical things like coding.

I've joined the VideoLAN project like 2 years ago, but haven't been very active. I've been helping `Felix Kühne <User:Fkuehne>`__ with the German translation and I'm trying to improve the wiki in as many ways I can. Although still being a C++ newbie, I'm looking forward to contribute to VLC media player itself soon (especially to it's brand new `Qt Interface <Qt_Interface>`__ to which I'm also fairly new). From time to time I'm getting the latest nighties to see if everything (still) works fine on Windows. See `my contributions <Special:Contributions/Materthron>`__ if you're more curious.

See my `Notes and Ideas <User:Materthron/NotesAndIdeas>`__.
