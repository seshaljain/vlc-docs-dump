My name is Philipp Weissenbacher, I'm a third semester cs student at the
University of Vienna. My primary field of interest is HCI and i18n and
to a lesser extent more technical things like coding.

I've joined the VideoLAN project like 2 years ago, but haven't been very
active. I've been helping [[User:Fkuehnemy contributions]] if you're
more curious.
