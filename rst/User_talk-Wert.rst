Windows deutch page
-------------------

You lately modified `Windows <Windows>`__ wiki page page from English to Deuch. I will cancel your edit:

-  Official pages are written in English
-  Your edit delete this English contribution (overwriting with Deutch)
-  Your edit mess up the page (because of blank lines or spaces removed at beginning of some lines mainly)

I will copy your contribution to `User:Wert/draft-de-windows <User:Wert/draft-de-windows>`__ for it to not be lost. But you should consider to merge it with the already existing `De/Windows <De/Windows>`__ page. Before, you will have to clean your draft.
