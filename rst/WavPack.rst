{{Codec audioWavPack}} {{Open}}

WavPack is a [[lossless]] audio [[compression]] codec. It supports more
than just [[WAVE]], despite its name.

FIXME: It is unclear how {{VLC}} reads this format, but the
{{VLCSourceFilemodules/codec/avcodec/fourcc.c}}, maybe it is supported
through {{docmod|avcodec}}?
