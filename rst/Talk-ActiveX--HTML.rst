Plugin parameters
-----------------

-  How to change the colour of vlc player?

-  How to show the *play/stop/forward/volume/etc.* controls in the display area ?

-  How to make the OBJECT tag compatible with both MSIE and M.Firefox?

-  How to specify a cache preload time?

Implementation dificulties
--------------------------

-  With the standard MS-I.Explorer 6 security configuration, user must modify manually the "Download unsigned controls for ActiveX" parameter, to make possible to install the VLC plugin. Could be the "axvlc.cab" distribution well signed for MSIE? --`Narcis Garcia <User:Narcisgarcia>`__ 01:00, 3 September 2007 (CEST)

Bugs
----

On the demo page edited by damienf, the playback stops on 80% of the track with all mp3 tracks and sources that i tried. So i test more simple, with only an object and autoplay parameter, and the same problem came back: vlc activeX/html plugin stops on 80% in average.

-  Any idea ?
