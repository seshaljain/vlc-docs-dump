== Discussion about API ==

[[User:OlivierAuberttalk]]) And isn't that too VLC-specific ? The rest
of the API (minus suggested VLM, which is clearly identified) is fairly
generic. We could move vlc specific features in an 'extra' module.

[[User:Zorglubtalk]]) The generic part is actually very worrying to me.
I think we anyway should ''definitely'' have "VLC" in the symbol names,
to avoid any clashes. "mediacontrol" is far too generic to me.

[[User:Littlejohntalk]]) At the moment the opportunity an external
developer has to use this interface is very little. There are coding
issues making the interface usable only within the VLC tree. See
[http://bugzilla.videolan.org/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2189
this] bug I filed.

[[User:OlivierAuberttalk]]) I would like to precise the context that
lead me to implement this API: I am developping an application that
needs to control some video player. I do not want it to be bound to a
single player, so I first defined a control API, reusing some OMC
specification, and then wrote the code to implement that interface on
some players. I did that (at python level, using rc communication) for
mplayer, xine and (at C level) for VLC. So this API has been defined
based on user/programmer needs, rather than on VLC functionalities
exposed by some interface. I do not want to have to rewrite my
application when I finally find the time to write the same control
interface for the avidemux engine for instance (in order to get
frame-by-frame positioning.

In an ideal world, there would be a well-established standard API, that
would be supported by all major linux (and more) players : VLC, xine,
player... The mediacontrol aims to be a start at this.

[[User:Zorglubtalk]]) Here is what I propose :

-  We keep providing the normal LibVLC API in vlc/vlc.h
-  in vlc/vlc.h we also provide a "VLC_Control" API which gives access
   to much more data and uses a semi-object concept (with exceptions,
   playlist object, stream object, ...) It can include some VLC-specific
   things (VLM, Filters, ...)
-  We provide the "VLC implementation of mediacontrol" in vlc/control.h
   which is a wrapper around a common set of functions from VLC_Control.
   The symbols are prefixed with `vlc <>`__ to avoid symbol clashes, but
   nothing should be VLC specific here
-  The python binding provides access to vlc.MediaControl (no clash
   problem here as pyton (and java too) provide the notion of namespace)

[[User:Littlejohntalk]]) Here is a proposed plan to accomplish the
points zorglub listed:

-  rewrite playlist management to solve current issues with playlist
   (see the playlist section)
-  factorize the functions of all interesting (stream, etc) objects in
   vlc and write the VLC_Control API
-  implement mediacontrol interface using the VLC_Control API
-  complete support of mediacontrol in bindings

Since I'm not still very accostumed with VLC internals I cannot say how
to proceed with every object.

[[User:Zorglubtalk]]) Ok, but you are focusing on playlist, which is
only a minor point of this API rework :)

[[User:OlivierAuberttalk]]) Another proposed way to proceed (avoiding
too many levels of wrapping) :

-  define the (generic) mediacontrol API in a player- and
   language-independent way (using the current MediaControl.idl file as
   a start)
-  implement this API in VLC, using a VLC-specific prefix
   (`vlc_mediacontrol <>`__) for methods
-  extend this API with VLC-specific functions (VLM, filters...), with
   another prefix (`vlc_mediacontrol_ext <>`__)

This way, the number of wrappers would be minimized, and we can
accomodate both generic and vlc-specific APIs. I do not know if you
agree on the usefulness of first defining an API based on what is
needed, then seeing how this API can be implemented in the player.

[[User:Littlejohntalk]]) I see having more layers as an opportunity to
implement a stable mediacontrol interface. The current VLC API problem
is APIs being changed constantly, and this prevents the possibility to
expose such APIs (defined as private). Layering would indeed allow to
expose a set of stable functions programmers can use, and focus changes
on the inner levels. Anyway I do agree in defining the interface before
bothering about actual implementation in the player.

== API Design ==

[[User:OlivierAuberttalk]]) For me, the mediacontrol API is a generic
API, independent from the player. If the player does not support some
feature (like position parameter to pause and resume), then the API
should try its best to have a coherent behaviour.

[[User:Littlejohntalk]]) Well, I think even if the interface is generic
it has to call functions contained in the player. For example the
position parameter for pause and resume should be implemented in the
player and then called by the mediacontrol interface. In this way we
have to opportunity to enrich the player and ease maintainance of the
interface (otherwise features in the interface could overlap with those
in the player or changes in the player could break the interface).

== Stream Information ==

-  mediacontrol_get_status_information ''Return synthetized information
   (position, url, status), so that applications can quickly get it
   ([http://liris.cnrs.fr/advene/ Advene] for instance calls this method
   every 100ms)''
-  '''mediacontrol_get_video_information''' ''Return misc. information
   about the video (aspect ratio, dimensions, bitrate, codec, author,
   etc).

== Playlist ==

[[User:OlivierAuberttalk]]) Could be transformed into a Playlist object
(returned by MediaControl.playlist), that would feature the
corresponding methods: add, clear, next, prev, play, sort...

[[User:Littlejohntalk]]) This is ok for me. Maybe we could apply this
abstraction to other parts of the interface, ie having a Stream object
and so on.

[[User:Littlejohntalk]]) The current playlist implementation makes it
impossible to correctly honor the position argument in
`mediacontrol <>`__\ <startpause|etc>. The problem is that moving
through the playlist implies playing the item we moved to. It should be
possible to move in the playlist without automatically playing the item.
Doing so we have the possibility to add the "start-time" option before
starting to play. We could think about two ways of doing so: either let
playlist_Next() accept a position parameter or make playlist_Next not to
start playing. So playing should be possible only from playlist_Play and
playlist_Play should accept the position parameter.
