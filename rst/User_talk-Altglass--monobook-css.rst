HI. How can we try your CSS? (other than replacing the default
monobook.css) [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 12:22, 26 June 2007 (CEST)

:Create a subpage called monobook.css in your account page. So that
would be in your case [[User:Dionoea/monobook.css]]. Copy my css into
there. But be aware that it will only work while I'm only since I link
to images on my home server atm. [[User:Altglass|Altglass]] 13:48, 26

::Hum, i used Firefox' developper tools instead :) The CSS looks
great... next you'll need to do one for the forum :) (using the nice
cone we used to have on the old forum... i'll give you the url if you
want) [[User:DionoeaDionoea]] 16:01, 26 June 2007 (CEST) ::::Well, first
I was told to do the nightlies and the trac css, so still a bunch of
work to do :) nice that you like it [[User:Altglassjb]] 09:52, 27 June
2007 (CEST) :::::: Where did the CSS go ?!? (Do you need special rights
to edit the main skin page?) [[User:DionoeaAltglass]] 14:03, 27 June
2007 (CEST) :::::::: Hum, looks like my proxy wasn't updating the css
correclty. (and about the rights question, I was asking if you wanted
those rights or not in case they were needed) [[User:DionoeaDionoea]]
16:21, 27 June 2007 (CEST) Starting from the left again ;) I mailed the
images and css to j-b and he overwrote the main.css I don't think that I
need rights to edit the [[Main Page]]. [[User:Altglass|Altglass]] 15:46,
