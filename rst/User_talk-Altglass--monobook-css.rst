HI. How can we try your CSS? (other than replacing the default monobook.css) `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 12:22, 26 June 2007 (CEST)

   Create a subpage called monobook.css in your account page. So that would be in your case `User:Dionoea/monobook.css <User:Dionoea/monobook.css>`__. Copy my css into there. But be aware that it will only work while I'm only since I link to images on my home server atm. `Altglass <User:Altglass>`__ 13:48, 26 June 2007 (CEST)

      Hum, i used Firefox' developper tools instead :) The CSS looks great... next you'll need to do one for the forum :) (using the nice cone we used to have on the old forum... i'll give you the url if you want) `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 15:55, 26 June 2007 (CEST)

            Well, first I was told to do the nightlies and the trac css, so still a bunch of work to do :) nice that you like it `Altglass <User:Altglass>`__ 09:32, 27 June 2007 (CEST)

               It is a nice skin, I really like it. However, IE6 does not display it correctly, but I think I call that a feature. The submenu (article, and edit...) is not so easy to read because of the stripes, but that is only my PoV `jb <User:J-b>`__ 09:52, 27 June 2007 (CEST)

                  Where did the CSS go ?!? (Do you need special rights to edit the main skin page?) `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 11:53, 27 June 2007 (CEST)

                     @j-b: Well yeah that's a feature, though I can read it pretty well using FF2 + Windows ClearType. Well to improve readability I could lighten the stripes, tell me if you want me to do so.
                     @dionoea: I removed the css from my profile as it is now implemented as the default skin. http://wiki.videolan.org/skins/monobook/main.css <- there the css is located now. And yes you need special rights to edit `Main Page <Main_Page>`__. - `Altglass <User:Altglass>`__ 14:03, 27 June 2007 (CEST)

                        Hum, looks like my proxy wasn't updating the css correclty. (and about the rights question, I was asking if you wanted those rights or not in case they were needed) `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 16:14, 27 June 2007 (CEST)
                        Btw, I couldn't find your edit to the main css in the recent changes log. Previous css modifications were done on page `MediaWiki:Monobook.css <MediaWiki:Monobook.css>`__. Where did your change go? `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 16:21, 27 June 2007 (CEST)

Starting from the left again ;) I mailed the images and css to j-b and he overwrote the main.css I don't think that I need rights to edit the `Main Page <Main_Page>`__. `Altglass <User:Altglass>`__ 15:46, 28 June 2007 (CEST)
