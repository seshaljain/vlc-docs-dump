list update
-----------

Can't we automatically build this list by searching all the pages using the "howto" template ? -- `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 17:30, 20 January 2006 (CET)

   Adding the `template <Template:howto>`__ should automatically add the page to `:Category:How To <:Category:How_To>`__, so we can use that. There's a few on the list that are all on one page (so aren't listed there) and also for some reason `How to Create a DVD <How_to_Create_a_DVD>`__ isn't listed there. --`H2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 17:53, 20 January 2006 (CET)
   Please read `Template_talk:Howto <Template_talk:Howto>`__ and post comments there. --`tonsofpcs <User:Tonsofpcs>`__ 09:33, 21 January 2006 (CET)

Curating this section of the wiki
---------------------------------

| I plan on renaming all ~70 `:Category:How To <:Category:How_To>`__ pages in the next few days; I think the wiki might benefit from being organized – specifically; I want to cut down on duplicate articles being in circulation, and help readers find what they're looking for on the first try. The following is a record of what I'm doing (and will do, if my weekend is otherwise uneventful).
| I'm going to borrow [//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_titles Wikipedia's system] and apply it *to only* these 70 articles:

-  Articles should be written in sentence case, i.e., don't capitalize the second or subsequent words in an article title, unless the title is a proper name
-  Article titles should be clear and predictable
-  Singular forms of words are preferred

| The parent page will be `VLC HowTo <VLC_HowTo>`__, so we can have (for example) `VLC HowTo/Do something cool <VLC_HowTo/Do_something_cool>`__.
| I hope to merge/delete duplicate titles in this category (how did we get at least 4 separate articles regarding setting brightness/contrast alone?) and make article titles more sensible.
| Hope this will be an improvement! 05:02, 30 October 2016 (CET)
