Typo
----

It seems that ``SV1`` is not a supported codec. ``SV1`` is not mentioned in nor in `ffmpeg.git <https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob;f=Changelog>`__. The commitdiff is the first occurrence, ``SV1`` appearing to be a typo of ``SVQ1`` (Sorenson Video 1) when adding new supported formats in the description. Correcting. 07:53, 5 March 2019 (CET)
