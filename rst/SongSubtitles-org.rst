{{Historical|SongSubtitles.org appears to be defunct}} SongSubtitles.org
is a not-for-profit project aimed at cooperatively '''creating a base of
music subtitles'''.<br /> They advertise for {{VLC}} because of its
ability to display [[subtitles]] along with music.

With SongSubtitles.org and VLC, you can store lyrics files on your
computer once for all, and have them displayed automatically when you
listen to music. SongSubtitles.org uses [[SubRip]] as the format for
subtitles.

== Project's Contents ==

The project consists of two different things: \* a website for sharing
subtitles \* a software you can use to create subtitles easily.

== Current Problems ==

Currently in VLC, one thing prevents subtitles to be loaded
automatically under Windows: the use of DOS-type filenames limited to 8
characters. However it will probably be fixed in the next versions of
VLC.

Another small problem is that when you use the scrolling bar to move to
another place in the file, subtitles stop being displayed.

Both of these problems are not specific to subtitles with music, they
happen with movies too.
