Buying music online which can play with `VLC media player <VLC_media_player>`__ is tricky. Most online stores and record companies use `DRM <DRM>`__, which disables the ability to play files in all `media players <media_player>`__ other than a few `proprietary <proprietary>`__ players which support the DRM they use.

However, there are solutions. Defective by Design has `a listing for DRM-free music sites <https://www.defectivebydesign.org/guide/audio>`__. Others are suggested below:

Buy music from sources that don't use DRM
-----------------------------------------

These stores usually encode their music in the VLC-compatible `MP3 <MP3>`__ format
