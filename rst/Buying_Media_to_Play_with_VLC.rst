Buying music online which can play with [[VLC media player]] is tricky.
Most online stores and record companies use [[DRM]], which disables the
ability to play files in all [[media player]]s other than a few
[[proprietary]] players which support the DRM they use.

However, there are solutions. Defective by Design has
[https://www.defectivebydesign.org/guide/audio a listing for DRM-free
music sites]. Others are suggested below:

== Buy music from sources that don't use DRM == These stores usually
encode their music in the VLC-compatible [[MP3]] format \*

== Creative Commons ==

Some people release media files under [[creative commons]] licenses,
which are normally free and allow you to copy the files to your friends.
These files are also DRM-free. Some creative commons sites are listed
below: \* [http://www.creativecommons.org Creative Commons] \*

Sucks, one-man band and all CC releases]

== Play from a CD ==

VLC can play from CDs. To make sure your CD can be played anywhere, make
sure it carries the [[wikipedia:Image:Cdda.png|CDDA logo]].
