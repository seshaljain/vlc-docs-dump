==Project Abstract==

The primary goal of this project would be to improve the B-frame
decision algorithms by applying rate decision optimization to the
algorithms in an attempt to make better decisions, as well as do other
interesting things with frames.

==Weekly Schedules==

As a note, I spend my summer jumping back and forth between two
different homes, and while at the beach house I can occasionally not get
access to the internet, so while I may not be on IRC or respond timely
to e-mail, I do have my laptop and will still be working and testing
clips. I hope to get tethering support with my blackberry at some point
this summer.

'''Week 1 (May 26)''' Finish initial studying of the x264 source code.
Graduation falls during this week, so it occupied most of my time. As of
June 1st, school is over.

'''Week 2 (June 2)''' Starting work on B-frame decision

'''Week 3 (June 9)''' Will be out of town on June 11.

'''Week 4 (June 16)''' Will probably be out a few days this week, for
orientation at the university. Date is not yet scheduled for certain.

Other than what is listed above, I have no extended vacations planned,
though I may simply be out of contact while jumping around between the
houses on some days during the summer.
