I would suggest listing the testfiles up on the Wiki-page and numbering
them. Maybe include advance features like videofilters, special outputs,
the used acess-module and/or even the whole vlcrc configuration file.
When someone encounters a problem in QA he/she could refer to 'Test 1'
or 'Test A' or something that describes the setup and settings.

== Outdated ? == I think this page is outdated, it should be removed or
updated, but I don't really know what to put here...
