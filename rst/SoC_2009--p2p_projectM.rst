== Abstract == The goal of this Google Summer of Code is to implement
two feature that are missing in vlc: \* visualizations using libprojectM
library. \* p2p access capability

== Timeline ==

{-! May 26 \| Begining of the GSoC but work mainly on vlc next release
(a lot of bugs fixed) June 17 \| libprojectM module mostly finished,
code the p2p access July 6-12 \| Mid-term evaluation August 24 \| Final
evaluation \|}

== Actually == The projectM module is mostly finished and give good
results. You can try it (tested only under linux for the moment) from
[http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc-ivoire.git my git repository] and
compiling vlc with the --enable-projectm configure option. You will need
libprojectm-dev and an opengl provider module.
