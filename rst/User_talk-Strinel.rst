Hi, I tried to create a mosaic with vlc but it doesn't work. I have xp with vlc 086h. I read my stream well, but not the background and not the third video. I need helpon , how to proceed, where do I have to write the line of command? Thanks, excuse me for my english, i'm french.

-  Hi. To ask such questions, you must use the `forum <http://forum.videolan.org/>`__ or the IRC (irc.videolan.org #videolan). I doubt someone will answer you on the wiki. --`Thannoy <User:Thannoy>`__ 23:31, 7 September 2008 (CEST)
