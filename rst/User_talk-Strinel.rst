third video. I need helpon , how to proceed, where do I have to write
the line of command? Thanks, excuse me for my english, i'm french. \*
Hi. To ask such questions, you must use the [http://forum.videolan.org/
forum] or the IRC (irc.videolan.org #videolan). I doubt someone will
answer you on the wiki. --[[User:Thannoy|Thannoy]] 23:31, 7 September
