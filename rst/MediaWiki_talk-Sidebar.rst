== sitesupport-url ==

\* The link labelled 'sitesupport' needs changing. Perhaps should point
to http://www.videolan.org/contribute.html or [[Help_VideoLAN]]? \*\*
Right, or even delete it. This link is still here from the default wiki
configuration. I redirect it to [[Help_VideoLAN]] and will add
[http://www.videolan.org/contribute.html contribute.html] link in this
page. --[[User:ThannoyThannoy]] 09:54, 30 November 2009 (UTC)
