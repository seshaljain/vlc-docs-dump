sitesupport-url
---------------

-  The link labelled 'sitesupport' needs changing. Perhaps should point to http://www.videolan.org/contribute.html or `Help_VideoLAN <Help_VideoLAN>`__?

   -  Right, or even delete it. This link is still here from the default wiki configuration. I redirect it to `Help_VideoLAN <Help_VideoLAN>`__ and will add `contribute.html <http://www.videolan.org/contribute.html>`__ link in this page. --`Thannoy <User:Thannoy>`__ 09:46, 30 November 2009 (UTC)
   -  In fact I deleted this link, `Help_VideoLAN <Help_VideoLAN>`__ is already linked through "Help the project" link". --`Thannoy <User:Thannoy>`__ 09:54, 30 November 2009 (UTC)
