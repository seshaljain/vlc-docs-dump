I learned of VideoLAN as an alternative for the CCCP from Dattebayo when
Shippuuden switched over on 54, so I have downloaded it as an additional
option and would like to learn more about this, so I signed up for the
wiki to make any minor edits I might notice as I read through it, until
I can become more competant and informed regarding it.
