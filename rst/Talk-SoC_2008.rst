Any interest in a VLC port to the Next generation `Neuros OSD <http://www.neurostechnology.com>`__ `platform(pdf) <http://open.neurostechnology.com/files/Neuros-OSD-Multimedia-Platform-1.01.pdf>`__? VLC is going to be the media player for this device, so we're going to need a lot of resources (internal and external) to get it to production.
