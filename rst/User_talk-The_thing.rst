Logo 'next to' VideoLAN links.
------------------------------

Hi,

While looking around the wiki, I noticed the little icon that has been put in to be next to links. While this works for me in Firefox 3.5b4, for some reason, in my main browser (Safari 4 Public Beta) and in Chrome (2.0.172.27) the icons appear beneath the link, obscuring the text and the icons are missing *entirely* in Internet Explorer 7 (haven't checked IE8, I don't really use Windows much) and Konqueror 4...

If it's of any use, here is the code that MediaWiki 1.11 seems to use to show icons next to external links:

::

   #bodyContent a.external, #bodyContent a[href^="gopher://"] {
       -moz-background-clip:border;
       -moz-background-inline-policy:continuous;
       -moz-background-origin:padding;
       background:transparent url(http://wiki.videolan.org/skins/monobook/external.png) no-repeat scroll right center;
       padding-right:13px;
   }

so perhaps you could simply override that with 'http://www.videolan.org/favicon.ico'

One problem could be that the 'ico' format is not brilliant for inline images and a png would be more suitable... Yours is currently: MS Windows icon resource - 2 icons, 32x32, 256-colors

Altogether, I hope this helps sort out these little icons (or we could just remove them :P)

Welcome templates
-----------------

Hi 'The thing' - it might be better IMO to wait until the user has made at least one contribution, since a lot of the new users are probably spambots (username patterns are weird too).

BTW which developer, if any, are you on vlc-devel or IRC?

   yeah, honestly I thought the same thing about the welcoming. I was mst likely done with that anyway. As for the developing, I am not a developer. `The thing <User:The_thing>`__ :sup:`(`\ `Talk <User_talk:The_thing>`__\ :sup:`â€¢`\ `Contribs <Special:Contributions/The_thing>`__\ :sup:`)` 22:21, 22 February 2012 (CET)
