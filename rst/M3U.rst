**M3U** files are a type of `playlist <playlist>`__ where the location of each item on the playlist is placed on a new line.

Lines starting with a # are comments.

For example,

| ``# This is a comment``
| ``/music/opeth/white cluster.mp3``
| ``/music/moonlapse vertigo.mp3``
| ``http://ccmixter.org/a/song.mp3``
| ``/video/mononoke.avi``

The following might be list of web based radio stations. VLC affords the switching between these web-radio stations by selecting next or previous track.

| ``http://111.22.333.44:8024``
| ``http://55.666.7.888:8024``
| ``http://9.11.222.444:8024``

The MIME-type of M#U-files is audio/x-mpegurl
