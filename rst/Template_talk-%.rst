Shouldn't we have generic templates for console examples: like:

-  "regular user on anything but windows template":

``% ``\ **``{``\ ````\ ``{``\ ````\ ``{``\ ````\ ``The``\ ````\ ``command``\ ````\ ``}``\ ````\ ``}``\ ````\ ``}``**

-  "root user on anything but windows template":

``# ``\ **``{``\ ````\ ``{``\ ````\ ``{``\ ````\ ``The``\ ````\ ``command``\ ````\ ``}``\ ````\ ``}``\ ````\ ``}``**

-  "command on windows template":

``> ``\ **``{``\ ````\ ``{``\ ````\ ``{``\ ````\ ``The``\ ````\ ``command``\ ````\ ``}``\ ````\ ``}``\ ````\ ``}``**

(and maybe have aliases for "vlc command" ... which would prepend the vlc.exe or ./vlc or vlc or whatever automatically)
