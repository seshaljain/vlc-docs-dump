Shouldn't we have generic templates for console examples: like: \*
"regular user on anything but windows template": % '''{ { { The command
} } }''' \* "root user on anything but windows template": # '''{ { { The
command } } }''' \* "command on windows template": > '''{ { { The
command } } }''' (and maybe have aliases for "vlc command" ... which
would prepend the vlc.exe or ./vlc or vlc or whatever automatically)
