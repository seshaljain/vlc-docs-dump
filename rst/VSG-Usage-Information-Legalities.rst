== Is VLC legal in all countries?<br> ==

Probably not.

Specially DeCSS module might violate DMCA (and similar laws) and some
codecs would require licenses for personal/commercial use.

There haven't been any court cases related to VLC but specially
companies should make sure they pay license fees to license holders if
they use VLC commercially and use patented formats or codecs.
