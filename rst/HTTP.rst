:''Did you want the [[HTTP Interface]] module or how to [[Control VLC
via a browser]]?'' {{Protocol|HTTP}}

'''HTTP''' or '''HyperText Transport Protocol''' is an application
network layer developed in the early days of the Internet to transmit
{{HTML}} and text files. Today it's used for every kind of media, thanks
to its flexibility.

'''HTTPS''' or '''HyperText Transport Protocol Secure''' is HTTP with
[[TLS]] (encryption) to provide security and privacy.

{{VLC}} can use both HTTP and HTTPS for multimedia [[streaming]]. It can
read a stream from a server like Apache, or act like a server dumping
multimedia over the network.

Usage for HTTP:
   vlc <nowiki>http://host\ [:port]/file</nowiki>
