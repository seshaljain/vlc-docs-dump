**libvcdinfo** is a library that is part of `vcdimager <http://www.gnu.org/software/vcdimager>`__. The library gives the ability to query properties about a `VCD <VCD>`__ or `SVCD <SVCD>`__ such as information about the entries of a track and navigation information that is contained in the first ISO 9660 track .

Extensive documentation on the library and of its interface via doxygen is available in the vcdimager package. (It is also available online but www.vcdimager.org seems to be down again at the time of this writing.)
