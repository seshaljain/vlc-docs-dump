== Linking to a specific wikipedia page ==

It would be nice if you could use <nowiki>{{wikipediaDionoea]] 00:27, 17

: <nowiki>I tried to use {{{1AAC}} would be impossible. I'll switch it
back to the {{wikipediaH2g2bob]] 00:34, 17 January 2006 (CET)

::: I'm guessing the configuration has changed a bit since then, but I
just updated it to accept <nowiki>{{wikipedia}} (for a link to the page
name), {{wikipediaFoobarMichaelBillington]] 04:30, 14 September 2010

:::: I updated it to accept up to 4
articlesâ€”<nowiki>{{wikipediabarqux}}</nowiki> now works, as does
<nowiki>{{wikipedia}}</nowiki> and
<nowiki>{{wikipediaFoobar|label1=Foobar alt name}}</nowiki> will display
the link as "Foobar alt name". Hope this makes sense!
