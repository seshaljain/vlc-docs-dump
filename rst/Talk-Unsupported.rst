OS/2 archaic? dead? OS/2 Warp is not dead. It lives in eComStation;
http://www.ecomstation.com . There are still many using and updating
OS/2 as eCS. IBM will continue to update it. Serenity Systems will
continue to sell eCS as long as there are those who want to use it.
According to Serenity Systems, it will be around for quite a long time
(check their site).

I must agree with the person above, as OS/2 still technically lives on
as eComStation. If Firefox/TBird/SeaMonkey has been ported to it, then
I'm sure VLC can be ported to it. It's not a matter of "how", it's a
matter of "who". And I must say that "archaic" and "dead" are a bit...
over the top. A bit off topic but, I've seen OS/2 run Win 3.x and DOS
apps at full speed on a PPC machine, that's not quite "archaic" in my
book.

If I have time, I may dabble into (attempting) to port VLC to OS/2.
