Link to Wikimedia, not Wikipedia
--------------------------------

Shouldn't the Editing Help at the foot of an 'Editing' Page, ie. the content of this page, link to a Wikimedia page, and not to a Wikipedia page? `Stq <User:Stq>`__

   Agreed; it's a much better editing help reference, too. The wikipedia one has various style guides for encyclopedic referencing, etc. I've updated the link. --`Gth <User:Gth>`__ 18:16, 23 April 2012 (CEST)

Anyone else see the videolan witch-hat obscuring the last few letters of any external link in their browser? --`Gth <User:Gth>`__ 18:16, 23 April 2012 (CEST)
