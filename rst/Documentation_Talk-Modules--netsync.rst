This one might be a hardy to get working. After a two hour testing
period I've come to the conclusion that I can't do it, but it would be
awsome if someone could help out, to get this one working! :) : Last
time I tried it worked fine. (Note that the forum is more appropriate
for VLC support) [[User:DionoeaHellimod]] ::: 1/ I didn't tell you to
get lost. 2/ I told you that you'd be more likely to get help in the
forum. I'm sorry if you felt offended but that's how I answered all the
"support like" questions asked in wiki edits recently. (And I doubt that
I'd be able to help you more if you don't provide details about what you
were doing and how ... but that's another issue)

::::I've just been trying to get it working too, im pretty sure its
working now. What i did was to remove the "--control netsync" option
from the clients options and it started working. To clarify: :Server:
%''' vlc udp://@239.255.1.1 --control netsync --netsync-master ''' :And
clients: %''' vlc udp://@239.255.1.1 --netsync-master-ip 192.168.0.1 '''
