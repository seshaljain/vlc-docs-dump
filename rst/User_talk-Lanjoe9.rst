'''A:''' I don't like Windows Media Player so I really don't know what
version 9 can or cannot do, however VLC can play most media formats from
the Internet (it was designed to play/stream video over a network),
though I don't know whether it can be configured to launch from web
pages when needed, because I don't use windows much (as a matter of fact
I try to avoid it as much as possible).

To see online video, you need to visit the page, right-click on the
video URL and copy it (or somehow extract the video URL from the page's
source code) and then open VLC, click on the "EJECT" button and paste
the URL in the MRL Locator (topmost) box. Please bear in mind that you
need to have a lot of bandwidth (at least broadband) to be able to view
online video.
