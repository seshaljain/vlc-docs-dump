**A:** I don't like Windows Media Player so I really don't know what version 9 can or cannot do, however VLC can play most media formats from the Internet (it was designed to play/stream video over a network), though I don't know whether it can be configured to launch from web pages when needed, because I don't use windows much (as a matter of fact I try to avoid it as much as possible).

To see online video, you need to visit the page, right-click on the video URL and copy it (or somehow extract the video URL from the page's source code) and then open VLC, click on the "EJECT" button and paste the URL in the MRL Locator (topmost) box. Please bear in mind that you need to have a lot of bandwidth (at least broadband) to be able to view online video.
