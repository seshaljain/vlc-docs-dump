Hi, the Documentation namespace should be self contained. No links
outside of the namespace should be present except in footnotes. Please
read the [[Documentation:EditingGuidelines]] for more details. (And it'd
be nice if each doc would be mostly self contained) Thanks for helping
with the doc (which too few people unfortunately seem to have time to
do), [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 16:06, 23 January 2008 (CET)
