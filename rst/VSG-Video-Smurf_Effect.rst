== Why is my video purple? (a.k.a. the smurf effect) ==

<br>Not sure. But many people have fixed this problem by changing their
video output module.<br>

Go to Preferences -&gt; Video -&gt; Output modules, and set Video output
module to something different, like DirectX video output.

Be sure you have advanced options enabled to be able to access this
option.

Also, you might need to disable the "YUV -&gt; RGB" checkbox in DirectX
section of Preferences -&gt; Video -&gt; Output modules.<br>
