Why is my video purple? (a.k.a. the smurf effect)
-------------------------------------------------

| Not sure. But many people have fixed this problem by changing their video output module.
| Go to Preferences -> Video -> Output modules, and set Video output module to something different, like DirectX video output.

Be sure you have advanced options enabled to be able to access this option.

| Also, you might need to disable the "YUV -> RGB" checkbox in DirectX section of Preferences -> Video -> Output modules.
