The libdvbpsi is a `library <library>`__ so it can also be used with extra programs that need `DVB <DVB>`__ and PSI decoders and generators.

libdvbpsi makes `VLC media player <VLC_media_player>`__ or other projects capable of `demultiplexing <demultiplex>`__ a satellite DVB stream. The library aims at making it easy to decode PSI tables (such as PAT, PMT etc.) present in a TS/DVB stream.
