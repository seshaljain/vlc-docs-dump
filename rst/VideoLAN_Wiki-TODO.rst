\* [[:Category:How To|VLC's HowTOs]] to reorganise. I suggest we use a
VLC_HOWTO: or start all the pages by `HOWTO <>`__ \*\* In action **\*
After some thought, I believe the best solution is to use a subpage
system with consistent title casing; adding a custom namespace would
require editing [//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:LocalSettings.php
LocalSettings.php], and inelegant page names such as <span
style="white-space:nowrap; color:blue;">HOWTO_Fixing .flv to .avi with
FFmpeg</span> would be avoided. Also, that would allow us to link back
to the parent page, ideally [[VLC HowTo]].

See my post on [[Talk:VLC HowTo]]. I'm curating these pages.
