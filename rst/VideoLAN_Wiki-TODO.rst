TODOs
-----

-  `VLC's HowTOs <:Category:How_To>`__ to reorganise. I suggest we use a VLC_HOWTO: or start all the pages by HOWTO\_

   -  In action

      -  After some thought, I believe the best solution is to use a subpage system with consistent title casing; adding a custom namespace would require editing [//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:LocalSettings.php LocalSettings.php], and inelegant page names such as HOWTO_Fixing .flv to .avi with FFmpeg would be avoided. Also, that would allow us to link back to the parent page, ideally `VLC HowTo <VLC_HowTo>`__. 03:35, 1 January 2015 (CET)
