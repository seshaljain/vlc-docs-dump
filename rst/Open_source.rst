:''See how the Open Source Initiative defines
[https://opensource.org/osd open source]'' '''Open source''' is a way to
license software. This type of software allows you to: \* Share the
software with your friends for free \* View and edit the [[source code]]
\* Use the software in your own open source projects \* Modify the
software in the way you like it \* Usually, you can download the
software from a website for free.

There are normally some conditions about doing these things. These
conditions are usually there to protect the developers against being
sued for giving you their software, or to stop other people claiming
they wrote the code.
