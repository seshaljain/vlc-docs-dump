{{wikipediaCategory:Libraries}}

A '''library''' is a bundle of code which other programs can use. For
example, if a program wanted to open a [[JPEG]] image file, it might ask
a library to convert it to a format it understands, rather than write
new code to decode JPEGs.

Libraries are normally shared throughout your computer. Normally the
library is only loaded into memory once, so if you're running two
programs from the same library, you will save memory.

Using libraries has many other advantages. If changes need to be made to
some code in a library, you can just update the library file and all the
programs will be updated.
