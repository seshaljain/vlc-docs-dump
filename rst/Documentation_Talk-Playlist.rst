No playlist buttons
-------------------

The randomizing instructions here don't make any sense for any version of VLC I can recall. I'm using 2.1.5 on Mac OS X, and the playlist window has no such buttons as those described under `Documentation:Playlist#Add Media Files to Playlist <Documentation:Playlist#Add_Media_Files_to_Playlist>`__. The playlist seems to auto-randomize. This can be controlled (along with repeat one, repeat all, etc.) only from the "Playback" menu. `SMcCandlish <User:SMcCandlish>`__ (`talk <User_talk:SMcCandlish>`__) 08:14, 25 August 2014 (CEST)

Have a look at the View menu. It lets you add those buttons to the main and playback windows. For further support, consider posting on http://forum.videolan.org --`feepk <User:Fkuehne>`__ (`talk <User_talk:Fkuehne>`__) 00:19, 1 September 2014 (CEST)
