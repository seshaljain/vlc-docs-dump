I checked out the lastest version of MobileVLC; But When I compiled with
the command: ./buildMobileVLC.sh -s -v, the build task failed with the
following message:

/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/libtool:
-dynamic not specified the following flags are invalid: -ObjC
/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/usr/bin/libtool:
can't open file:
/Users/haroldmei/Documents/MobileVLC/ImportedSources/vlc/projects/macosx/framework/../../../install-ios-Simulator/lib/vlc/plugins/misc/libxtag_plugin.a

My environment is Mac OS X 10.6.6, and the SDK version is 3.2.5.

Can anybody tell me what happened with the latest source code?

Thanks very much!
