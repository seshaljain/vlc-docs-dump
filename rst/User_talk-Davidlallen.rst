Hello, I don't really think you should have removed your code from the wiki. It is welcomed! We may however have wanted two differents section/wiki page for 0.8.6 and 0.9.0. Thanks! --`Pdherbemont <User:Pdherbemont>`__ 02:53, 20 August 2007 (CEST)

Um, please see the \*parent\* page on tutorials. I have added a complete working example for 0.8.6c and returned your page to the way it was. --`davidlallen <User:davidlallen>`__ 10:39, 20 August 2007 (PST)
