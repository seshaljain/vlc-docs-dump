{{Historical}} == Cross compile VLC for ARM-based platforms ==

Last updated: v0.0.2, 19 march 2004 This document describes all the
steps to cross compile vlc for ARM based platforms. It describes how to
build a cross compilation toolchain, how to build the libraries needed
by vlc and the compilation of the vlc itself.

== Introduction ==

This document is only a first draft. It does not intend to cover all
subjects and is written for vlc version 0.7.2. You may still have some
problems at some steps or find better way to do them. If you have any
comment do not hesitate to contact us. Which platforms are targeted ?

I will describe here how to compile vlc for an ARM based PDA running
linux. It includes for example :

\* Compaq - iPaq (H36xx, H38xx,...), using Familiar Linux \*\* GNU
Portable Environment (GPE) \*\* Opie \* YOPY/Linupy \* Zaurus

== Requirements for cross-compilation == === Why cross-compiling ? ===

It is of course possible to compile directly on the targeted platform.
But there are a lot of great advantages to cross-compile :

-  The most important one is probably the speed, because a desktop
   computer is most of the time faster than a PDA for compilation.
-  Another big problem is that a complete compilation toolchain does
   take a great amount of disk space. And this space is usually very
   limited on embedded systems.
-  And there also may not be enough memory to compile big files.

==Building the toolchain== ===Prerequisite=== ====Importants paths====

During this section, we will use the following paths :

I would personally advise to compile everything as a normal user and
then install everything as root.

====${SRCDIR}==== This is where the sources will be located and where
the compilation will be done. (eg: /usr/src or /home/foobar/arm-src).

====${PREFIX}====

This is where you want to install your cross compilation toolchain. It
can be either installed system-wide (in /usr/local/arm/2.95.3 for
example). Installation steps (i.e. make install) will have to be done as
root. Or it can be installed in user-land, for the user's own use
(/home/foobar/arm/2.95.3 for example). In this paper, the chosen prefix
is /usr/local/arm/2.95.3, you will have to adapt the commands to what
you choose..

====Files needed====

Download the following files and put them in the ${SRCDIR}. Most of them
are available on the "VideoLAN website".

-  binutils-2.11.2.tar.gz
-  linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2
-  patch-2.4.19-rmk4.bz2
-  gcc-2.95.3.tar.gz
-  gcc-2.95.3.diff.bz2
-  gcc-2.95.3.diffbis.bz2 - [File hard to find, Please post link to
   file]
-  gcc-2.95.3.diff2
-  glibc-2.2.5.tar.gz
-  glibc-linuxthreads-2.2.5.tar.gz
-  SDL-1.2.5.tar.gz
-  glib-1.2.10.tar.gz
-  ffmpeg.tar.gz
-  mad-0.14.2b.tar.gz
-  flac-1.1.0.tar.gz
-  libdvbpsi-0.1.2.tar.gz
-  a52dec-0.7.4.tar.gz

==Binutils==

Compiling binutils is pretty simple :
   tar -xzf binutils-2.11.2.tar.gz cd binutils-2.11.2 ./configure
   --target=arm-linux --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3 make make install

==Preparing linux kernel==

Before building the glibc library the right kernel header files should be available. Therefor the kernel that is going to be used needs to be prepared so all necessary header files are present. Follow these steps.
   tar -xzf linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2 bunzip2 patch-2.4.19-rmk4.bz2 cd
   linux-2.4.19 make mrproper patch -p1 < ../patch-2.4.19-rmk4.bz2 make
   clean ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-make ARCH=arm h3600_config

'''Do not forget''' to save the configuration even if no changes are made !
   make ARCH=arm menuconfig make symlinks ARCH=arm
   CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-mkdir -p
   /usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/include cp -Rf include/asm
   include/asm-arm include/linux /usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/include
   cd /usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux ln -s include sys-linux

==Basic cross compiler (gcc)==

   tar -xvzf gcc-2.95.3.tar.gz bunzip2 gcc-2.95.3.diff.bz2 bunzip2
   gcc-2.95.3.diffbis.bz2 patch -p1 -d gcc-2.95.3 < gcc-2.95.3.diff
   patch -p1 -d gcc-2.95.3 < gcc-2.95.3.diffbis cd gcc-2.95.3
   ./configure --target=arm-linux --disable-threads --enable-languages=c
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3 --with-headers=linux-2.4.19/include
   make make install

==Compiling glibc== Depending on your target, you may choose another
glibc version (eg: 2.1.3 for linupy 1.4) tar -xvzf glibc-2.2.5.tar.gz cd
glibc-2.2.5 tar -xvzf ../glibc-linuxthreads-2.2.5.tar.gz
CC=arm-linux-gcc ./configure arm-linux --target=arm-linux
--prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux --enable-add-ons

The following step takes quite a long time!
   CC=arm-linux-gcc make

If you have problems compiling glibc due to pread/pwrite, edit sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/kernel-features.h and turn \__ASSUME_PREAD_SYSCALL and \__ASSUME_PWRITE_SYSCALL from 1 to 0.
   CC=arm-linux-gcc make install

==Full cross compiler (gcc)==

Now it is time to build a cross-compiler that can built user space libraries too. Follow these steps:
   rm -Rf gcc-2.95.3 tar -xvzf gcc-2.95.3.tar.gz patch -p1 -d gcc-2.95.3
   < gcc-2.95.3.diff patch -p1 -d gcc-2.95.3 < gcc-2.95.3.diff2 cd
   gcc-2.95.3 ./configure --target=arm-linux
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3 make make install

==Misc==

Add /usr/local/arm/2.95.3/bin to your PATH. Add the following line (depends on your shell) to your shell's configuration file :
   export PATH=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/bin:$PATH

I would advise you to completely log out and then log in again, so that
the change would be taken into account. You can now check that when you
type arm-linux-gcc, it launches the cross-compiler.

Next are some packages that you may compile by yourself, but I found it
was easier to use the precompiled packages. You can take them at
"ipkgfind">. You may find packages with other version numbers which
should not be a problem.

-  libgcc1_3.1.1-1_arm.ipk This provides libgcc.so.1 which is needed to
   compile some libraries.
-  xlibs_4.1-5_arm.ipk, xlibs-dev_4.1.0-16_arm.ipk Those are the
   libraries ans the development files for X windows.
-  zlib1g_1.1.4-3_arm.ipk, zlib1g-dev_1.1.3-fam1_arm.ipk These libraries
   are needed by some libraries to compile.

Install these packages on your compiler box in
/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux : You can use the script install.sh :

   #!/bin/sh # script to install .ipk into the arm-toolchain # usage :
   ./install.sh foobar.ipk

   if ! tar -xvzf $1 2> /dev/null then ar xv $1 2> /dev/null fi cp
   data.tar.gz /usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux cd
   /usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux tar -xvzf data.tar.gz

==Setting up Opie cross-compile environment==

Download the Opie SDK from the website [http://opie.handhelds.org/ OPIE
website] using the menuitem "Download Opie SDK" or try the direct link
here: "Download Opie SDK". Download all files to your ${SOURCES}/opie
directory. Opie SDK

The Opie SDK does not come with a README file or installation instructions. I give them here instead. There are two tar files in the download a OpieSDK.tar.gz2 and a kdevelop_src.tar.bz2. The last file is a modified kdevelop for use with the OpieSDK. In this tutorial we will not use that. Unpack OpieSDK.tar.bz2 in your sources cd ${SOURCES}/opie directory.
   cd ${SOURCES}/opie tar -xjvf OpieSdk.tar.bz2

It creates a directories structure ${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSDK. Inside that directory a script is present to start_kdevelop. Modify this script so that it uses the correct paths for you setup.
   #!/bin/sh source ${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/dev_env

   export KDEDIR=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/kde export
   PATH=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/kde/bin:$PATH kbuildsycoca kdevelop

Save the script. Do the same with the script arm_source
   source ${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/dev_env export QTDIR=$QTDIR_ARM
   export OPIEDIR=$OPIEDIR_ARM

Save the script and modify the script host_source in the same manner as above.
   source ${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/dev_env export QTDIR=$QTDIR_NAT
   export OPIEDIR=$OPIEDIR_NAT

Save the script and modify the script dev_env in the same manner as above.
   export
   PYTHONPATH=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/python/opie:${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/python/sip
   export
   PATH=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/bin:/opt/OpieSdk/host_tools:${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/opie/x86/qt-2.3.7/bin:$PATH
   export PATH=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/opie/x86/qmake:$PATH export
   QTDIR_NAT=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/opie/x86/qt-2.3.7 export
   OPIEDIR_NAT=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/opie/x86/sdk export
   QTDIR_ARM=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/opie/arm/qt-2.3.7 export
   OPIEDIR_ARM=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/opie/arm/sdk export
   OPIE_SDK_BASE=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/ export
   OPIE_SDK_QMAKE_BASE=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/opie/x86/sdk/mkspecs/qws/
   export OPIE_DOC=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/apidocs

   export
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/sip/lib:$OPIEDIR_NAT/lib:$QTDIR_NAT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   export
   OPIE_LANGUAGES=de:en:cz:da:dk:es:fr:hu:it:ja:ko:lv:mk:nl:no:pl:pt:pt_BR:ru:sl:zh_CN:zh_TW

The symbolic linke to the tool qmake points now to the wrong place. We need to fix this symbolic link. Here is the way to do that.
   cd host_tools ln -sf
   ${SOURCES}/opie/opt/OpieSdk/opie/x86/sdk/qmake/qmake qmake cd ../

Now it is time to fire up our development environment and start hacking
in Opie.

==Cross compiling libraries needed by vlc==

Download ipaq-config.site to ${SOURCES}. When downloading source
tarballs copy them to your ${SOURCES} directory. Each section is
supposed to begin with cd ${SOURCES}.

===SDL===

It is not clean at all but did not found a better working method. Using
config.site it compiles well, but when linking with vlc there are
problems !

   /usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/bin should contain the cross compiler
   without the prefix arm-linux-. tar -xvzf SDL-1.2.5.tar.gz cd
   SDL-1.2.5 ./configure --enable-release --target=arm-linux
   --host=arm-linux --disable-esd
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr
   --x-includes=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr/X11R6/include
   --x-libraries=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr/X11R6/lib
   --disable-video-opengl

   export PATH=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/bin:$PATH

   make && make install

===Glib/GTK+===

   tar -xvzf glib-1.2.10.tar.gz cd glib-1.2.10
   CONFIG_SITE=../ipaq-config.site ./configure
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr make make install cd ..
   tar -xvzf gtk+-1.2.10.tar.gz cd gtk+-1.2.10
   CONFIG_SITE=../ipaq-config.site ./configure
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr
   --with-glib=../glib-1.2.10 make make install

===ffmpeg===

   tar -xvzf ffmpeg.tar.gz cd ffmpeg ./configure --arch=armv4l
   --cc=arm-linux-gcc --disable-mmx
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr --enable-shared cd
   libavcodec make

Vlc does not require that you install ffmpeg.

===mad===

   tar -xvzf mad-0.14.2b.tar.gz cd mad-0.14.2b ./configure
   --enable-release --target=arm-linux --host=arm-linux --disable-esd
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr
   --x-includes=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr/X11R6/include
   --x-libraries=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr/X11R6/lib
   --disable-video-opengl export
   PATH=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/bin:$PATH make

===gpe===

Not described.

===tremor===

Tremor is an integer decoder for the vorbis audio codec. Download the
source through subversion at the "xiph.org" website.

   svn co http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/Tremor cd Tremor
   CONFIG_SITE=../ipaq-config.site ./configure
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr make

===ogg===

For ogg, it is the same as Tremor.
   svn co http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/ogg cd ogg
   CONFIG_SITE=../ipaq-config.site ./configure
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr make

===flac===

   tar -xvzf flac-1.1.0.tar.gz cd flac-1.1.0 ./configure
   --enable-release --host=arm-linux --target=arm-linux
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr

It will probably fail (due to the xmms plugin), but it is not a problem, we will continue installation by hand.
   cp -Rf include/FLAC /usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/include cd
   src/libFLAC make install

===libdvbpsi===

   tar -xvzf libdvbpsi-0.1.2.tar.gz cd libdvbpsi-0.1.2 ./bootstrap
   ./configure --target=arm-linux --host=arm-linux make

===a52===

   tar -xvzf a52dec-0.7.4.tar.gz cd a52dec-0.7.4 ./configure
   --enable-release --host=arm-linux --target=arm-linux
   --prefix=/usr/local/arm/2.95.3/arm-linux/usr make && make install

==Cross compiling vlc itself==

First of all, run the ./bootstrap script. Then run one of the
ipkg/rules.*, according to what you want to compile. Finally you just
have to type make and you'll get a stand alone vlc.

Run arm-linux-strip to remove symbols and so the size of the file, and
now you can test it easily on your PDA.

Enjoy !
