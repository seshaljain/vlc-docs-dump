Qt Pimping
==========

Abstract
--------

Even though the current Qt Interface is reasonably good enough to experience the most capabilities of the VLC media player, there are lot of sections that can be more improved.

For example, in the current Qt user interface the main two elements are the video widget and the controller bar. All the other important sections like the playlist, media library, equalizer etc, use their own, separate, dialogs boxes. Therefore, it would be really great to combine all these most used features in one single window by re-designing the current interface.

Goals
-----

-  Pimp the current Qt UI by redesigning the layout. This will be done based on the `layout designs <http://people.videolan.org/~jb/VLC%20Layouts.png>`__ given by the mentor, `Jean-Baptiste Kempf <User:J-b>`__.

-  Design & Implement custom widgets as needed.

-  Add Qt Kinetics to the main UI. At first, Kinetics state animations will be added to the main video while changing the states of the player.

-  Integrate ML, Simple Playlist, Equalizer and other sections with the main layout.

-  Complete the Pimped VLC UI. :)
