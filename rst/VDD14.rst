Taxi from the airport is estimated at 30-40€ one way. Tipping (10-20%)
is optional but appreciated. If the driver offers to take the
''tunnel'', note that it involves a 3€ surcharge.

We recommend against renting a car as parking in the city can be
challenging (and also to many people, driving on the left side of the
road).

'''NOTE''': VideoLAN does not refund taxi expenses nor car rentals.
