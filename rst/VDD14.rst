Transportation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both hotels can be reached from the airport using the *Aircoach* bus service at 8€/one way, 14€/return. For the full list of bus services, `bus/coach check the airport site <http://www.dublinairport.com/gns/to-from-the-airport/by-bus-or-coach.aspx>`__.

Regular bus lines like `16 <http://www.dublinbus.ie/en/Your-Journey1/Timetables/All-Timetables/16-/>`__ every 20min for only 2.20 euro

Taxi from the airport is estimated at 30-40€ one way. Tipping (10-20%) is optional but appreciated. If the driver offers to take the *tunnel*, note that it involves a 3€ surcharge.

We recommend against renting a car as parking in the city can be challenging (and also to many people, driving on the left side of the road).

**NOTE**: VideoLAN does not refund taxi expenses nor car rentals.
