MPlayer (from *The Movie Player*) is a cross-platform `media player <media_player>`__ released under GPLv2. The recommended way to install is to compile source code from SVN, though builds (binaries) are available from third parties. Numerous `skins <https://mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html#skins>`__ are availableâ€”by default there is no skin, meaning no graphical user interface.

Work on the project began in 2000 and is still actively developed as of 2019, with extensive documentation and support lists.

There are common elements between and MPlayer, and the two projects share at least one contributor (Diego Biurrun). VLC `reuses <https://mplayerhq.hu/design7/projects.html#mplayer_code>`__ the MPlayer software scaler library (included with FFmpeg) and MPlayer can be `extended <https://mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/codec-installation.html#x264>`__ with the VideoLAN `x264 <x264>`__ library. `libdvdnav <libdvdnav>`__ and `libdvdcss <libdvdcss>`__ were included with MPlayer `until 1.2 <https://mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html#mplayer12>`__. VLC and MPlayer both currently use `FFmpeg <FFmpeg>`__ to `support <https://mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html>`__ many codecs, and `work is done <https://mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html#notdead>`__ to keep MPlayer, VLC and FFmpeg codec support in sync.
