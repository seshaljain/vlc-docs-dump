'''VideoLAN Organization''' is the non-profit foundation that develops
software for playing and streaming video and other media formats.
VideoLAN is most notable for its flagship product, {{VLC}}.

== History == {{Merge|Documentation:History}} The VideoLAN project was
started as a school project in 1996 by students of [http://www.ecp.fr
École Centrale Paris], a French engineering school. These students
wanted to be able to watch television on their PCs. (They also wanted to
upgrade the [http://www.via.ecp.fr VIA Centrale Réseaux] network so they
needed a bandwidth intensive application to justify the upgrade.)

They began writing [[VLS]] (VideoLAN Server) and the [[VLC media
player|VLC]] (VideoLAN Client) to stream and read [[MPEG-2]] streams.
They succeeded in serving and reading the first stream in 1998. These
two programs were planned to be modular, which meant a core consisting
basically of communication functions to be used by the modules. This
allowed easy porting of the OS specific modules.

In 2001, after many months (if not years) of negotiation,
[//images.videolan.org/images/paper.jpeg the school's Director agreed to
a change to the GPL licence]. Developers from all around the world
started working on the project right away. One of them (gibalou) even
submitted the Win32 port 6 months later!

The first large scale multicast streaming tests occurred in May 2002.
500 students on the VIA Centrale Réseaux network were able to
participate in these tests. In January 2003, the first MPEG4 streams
were tested and realtime MPEG4 encoding was available two months later.
