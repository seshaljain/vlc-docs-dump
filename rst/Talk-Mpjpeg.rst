It seems that ``jpga`` is not a supported video codec. It was \ `added <https://wiki.videolan.org/index.php?title=Mpjpeg&diff=prev&oldid=6484&diffonly=1>`__\  to `{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}} <{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}>`__ on 2006-12-17. `Git <https://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=blob;f=modules/mux/mpjpeg.c;hb=d3fe7f28797d4dba65ffcdd60bf932e758a48a9e#l161>`__ for that time suggests an error transcribing lines 167 and 168. Correcting. 08:52, 25 February 2019 (CET)
