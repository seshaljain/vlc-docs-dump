software#Closed-source software}}

Closed source (also known as proprietary software) is a way to licence
software. It is the opposite of [[open source]]. This type of software
usually forbids: \* Examining the source code (computer code) \*
Modifying the program \* Redistributing the program A closed source
license may place arbitrary restrictions on the program, including
[[DRM]], [[copy prevention]], and planned obsolescence. Users are not in
control of this type of software.
