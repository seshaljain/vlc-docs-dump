Closed source (also known as proprietary software) is a way to licence software. It is the opposite of `open source <open_source>`__. This type of software usually forbids:

-  Examining the source code (computer code)
-  Modifying the program
-  Redistributing the program

A closed source license may place arbitrary restrictions on the program, including `DRM <DRM>`__, `copy prevention <copy_prevention>`__, and planned obsolescence. Users are not in control of this type of software.
