About me
--------

| I am a largely anonymous participant in this interesting and fun project that is VideoLAN.
| I will describe myself with a quote from the film `V for Vendetta <Wikipedia:V_for_Vendetta>`__\ *:*

   "Who? Who is but the form following the function of what …"

… and what I am is an editor, computer hobbyist, and VLC enthusiast.

| I possess a fairly intimate knowledge of computers and can code in such languages as (X)HTML, C++, and JavaScript.
| I love and support VLC both philosophically (its open-source and free design) and personally (because I think it's wicked cool). I do some work around here copy-editing, expanding, and maintaining the documentation regarding VLC.
| If you think I can help out, or want to place questions, concerns, or anything else, drop me a line on `my talk page <{{TALKPAGENAME}}>`__. Cheers!
