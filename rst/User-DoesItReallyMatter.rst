Greetings! If you are looking for help, please check out [[Common
Problems]] or the [https://forum.videolan.org/ forum], not here, thanks!

== About me == I am a largely anonymous participant in this interesting
and fun project that is VideoLAN.<br /> I will describe myself with a
quote from the film ''[[Wikipedia:V for Vendetta|V for Vendetta]]:''

<blockquote>"Who? Who is but the form following the function of what
&hellip;"</blockquote>

&hellip; and what I am is an editor, computer hobbyist, and VLC
enthusiast.

I possess a fairly intimate knowledge of computers and can code in such
languages as (X)HTML, C++, and JavaScript.<br /> I love and support VLC
both philosophically (its open-source and free design) and personally
(because I think it's wicked cool). I do some work around here
copy-editing, expanding, and maintaining the documentation regarding
VLC.<br /> If you think I can help out, or want to place questions,
concerns, or anything else, drop me a line on [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|my talk
page]]. Cheers!
