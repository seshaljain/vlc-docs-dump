== About me == My name is Jérôme GINSS. I will graduate from the French
top school '''"ENSIMAG"''' (''"Ecole nationale supérieure d'informatique
et de mathématiques appliquées de Grenoble"'') in 2011. I am currently
involved in a first general one-year course including applied maths,
electronics, image processing... and of course computing as my major.
Before that, I majored in computer science in a two-year university
course.
