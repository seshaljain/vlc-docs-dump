About me
--------

My name is Jérôme GINSS. I will graduate from the French top school **"ENSIMAG"** (*"Ecole nationale supérieure d'informatique et de mathématiques appliquées de Grenoble"*) in 2011. I am currently involved in a first general one-year course including applied maths, electronics, image processing... and of course computing as my major. Before that, I majored in computer science in a two-year university course.

I'm interested in two different projects : enhancing VLC's user interface (involving C++ and Qt) and embedded development. I will publish more details as soon as possible.
