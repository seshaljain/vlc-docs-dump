== Requirements ==

-  A JDK version 5.0 or higher
-  VLMa binary package

== How to ==

First extract VLMa distribution archive to the folder of your choice,
you should see the following folders: \* bin/ Command line wrappers to
manage VLMa \* conf/ Configuration \* data/ Data \* lib/ Dependencies \*
logs/ Log directory \* webapps/ Webapps to deploy \* work/ Folder needed
by the servlet container

=== UNIX specific ===

Ensure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable has been set. Run the
following command: echo $JAVA_HOME

If it does not print anything to the standard input but whitespaces,
this means that JAVA_HOME has not been set. You can set JAVA_HOME using
the following command: export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/JDK/installation

Then open a terminal and go to the folder where you extracted VLMa. You
can run VLMa daemon by running the following command: bin/vlmad start

To run the web UI, open a new terminal and run:
   bin/vlmaw start

=== Windows specific ===

Ensure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable has been set and that it
points to a valid JDK installation. To do this, have a look at: \*
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310519 for Windows XP, \*
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931715 for Windows Vista.

Then open a prompt and change directory to where you extracted VLMa. You
can run VLMa daemon by running the following command: binvlmad start

To run the web UI, open a new prompt and run:
   binvlmaw start

== The end ==

To finish with, go to http://localhost:8080, you should see VLMa
dashboard which tells you which medias are currently streamed and the
list of servers VLMa didn't manage to contact through their telnet
interface.
