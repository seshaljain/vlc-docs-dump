{{websitehttps://xiph.org/flac/}} {{xiphperfect]] quality audio file.
FLAC files usually contain [[CD|CD quality]] audio, but can also support
almost any audio data with a wide range of sample frequencies, amount of
channels and bits per sample.

FLAC provides a smaller size of file than [[PCM]] [[WAV]] (about half
the size), but much larger than [[lossy]] codecs like [[MP3]]. MP3s are
about 5-10% the size of WAV files, but are lower quality.

A CD's worth of data is... \* 700MB as a CD \* 700MB as WAV \* '''300MB
as FLAC''' \* 40MB as MP3 (128 [[kbps]])

== Container format == {{muxencoder=y}} FLAC can be used inside several
[[container format]]s, such as [[ogg]] and [[matroska]], but can also be
stored in its own container.

{{VLC}} can encode FLAC starting with 0.7.0.

== Source code == {{fileinput demuxer}}
