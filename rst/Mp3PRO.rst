   {{Wikipedia|mp3PRO}}

mp3PRO is a proprietary codec that is no longer maintained. Its goal was to supersede the `mp3 <mp3>`__ format with a better `compression <compression>`__ ratio that had comparable audio quality or better (see `their archived site <https://web.archive.org/web/20150217185935/http://www.mp3prozone.com/basics.htm>`__ for an introduction). It used `spectral band replication <wikipedia:spectral_band_replication>`__ (SBR), which is `lossy <lossy>`__ compression, but in a way indistinguishable to the human ear. The site seems to have vanished around 2015.
