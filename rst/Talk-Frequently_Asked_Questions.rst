Consider adding something on ffmpeg:

'''Question:''' The version of ffmpeg that comes with vlc doesn't do x,
but the latest release of ffmpeg can, when will ffmpeg be updated?

'''Answer:''' ffmpeg is updated when ever there is a minor version
updated. For example 0.8.9 to 0.9.0 (major.minor.debug)

Also something about why Mac version is missing feature x when Windows
and Linux have it.--[[User:Ajmas|Ajmas]] 04:59, 5 January 2008 (CET)

== Question to Authors ==

Why it is impossible to connect external decoder in VLC media player?
