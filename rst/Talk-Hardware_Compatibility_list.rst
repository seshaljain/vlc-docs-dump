"MPEG2 capture on windows possibly broken" — December 2006
----------------------------------------------------------

I've moved this big block of text down to a footnote; I wasn't sure how one is supposed to do it on this wiki (without Wikipedia's tempaltes), so I used a <span> with an ID to create an anchor (<a> was filtered). It would be nice if the source/author of the quotation were cited, to give a bit of context. Some specifics on the configuration of the setup in question would also be nice. — `Tom W.M. <User:Tom_W.M.>`__ 03:38, 6 December 2006 (CET)
