== "MPEG2 capture on windows possibly broken" &mdash; December 2006 ==

I've moved this big block of text down to a footnote; I wasn't sure how
one is supposed to do it on this wiki (without Wikipedia's tempaltes),
so I used a &lt;span&gt; with an ID to create an anchor (&lt;a&gt; was
filtered). It would be nice if the source/author of the quotation were
cited, to give a bit of context. Some specifics on the configuration of
the setup in question would also be nice. &mdash; [[User:Tom W.M.|Tom
