[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/elapsed%7CAdj. elapsed - (of time) having passed or slipped by; "elapsed time"] thanks --`Jan <User:J4n>`__ 06:05, 6 February 2012 (UTC)

   And your point is? That's the way it should be spelled "elapsed", not "elepased" time. Please correct your own ignorance before you try to be cocky and correct others. `Edwardw <User:Edwardw>`__ 20:21, 6 February 2012 (UTC)

      I was thanking you for pointing the spelling mistake out... --`Jan <User:J4n>`__ 23:32, 6 February 2012 (UTC)

         OK, no problem, sorry for the misunderstanding. `Edwardw <User:Edwardw>`__ 12:09, 7 February 2012 (UTC)
