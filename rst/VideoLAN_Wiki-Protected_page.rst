Hello,

   You'd probably be better off asking this in the forum - http://forum.videolan.org - and not here.
   VLS doesn't have a graphical interface - I think telnet and specifying opeions on the command line are the only ways to control it - http://www.videolan.org/doc has some details.
   In most cases you'd be better off using vlc.
   One thing that works in vlc, and probably also in vls (but I'm not sure) is to run

``vls -l``

   which lists all modules (encoders, muxers, decoders and interfaces). Other interfaces you can use will be listed.
