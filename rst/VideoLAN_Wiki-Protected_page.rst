Hello, :You'd probably be better off asking this in the forum -
http://forum.videolan.org - and not here. :VLS doesn't have a graphical
interface - I think telnet and specifying opeions on the command line
are the only ways to control it - http://www.videolan.org/doc has some
details. :In most cases you'd be better off using vlc. :One thing that
works in vlc, and probably also in vls (but I'm not sure) is to run vls
-l :which lists all modules (encoders, muxers, decoders and interfaces).
Other interfaces you can use will be listed. :--[[User:H2g2bob|H2g2bob]]
