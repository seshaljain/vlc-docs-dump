Hope no-one has any objection to starting a description of the options
under the GUI menu system. I will try to fill in teh meanings of options
as I check or discover them. [[User:Facius|Facius]] 18:20, 20 January

Does anyone know why there is no "Navigation" menu in Mac OS X? I find
it very convenient in the windows version and I'd like to see it added.
Thanks.
