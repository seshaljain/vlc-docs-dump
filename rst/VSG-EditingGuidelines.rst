VSG pages are divided into two categories: terminal pages and
nonterminal pages.

==Nonterminal Pages==

Nonterminal pages are pages which do not contain solutions. These are
pages which prompt the user for more information, directing them to
pages which describe their problem in more detail.

A typical nonterminal VSG page should appear as follows:

<nowiki>__NOTOC__</nowiki>

<nowiki>=Title of Page=</nowiki>

(A question prompting the user for more detail on the issue he or she is
experiencing)

(At least two VSGEntry objects directing the user to a page with more
detail on solving the problem)

==The VSGEntry Template== The VSGEntry Template is invoked as follows:
<nowiki>{{VSGEntryLink|Description}}</nowiki>
