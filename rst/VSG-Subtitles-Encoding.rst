== VLC doesn't display all subtitles. ==

<br>If VLC has autodetected your subtitles file, or if you opened it
manually, but VLC only diplays some subtitles from time to time, you
will need to change the subtitles file encoding.

<br>Go to Preferences -&gt; Input / Codecs -&gt; Other codecs -&gt;
Subtitles, and set Subtitle text encoding to the right one.

<br>See this reference:

various characters sets].<br>
