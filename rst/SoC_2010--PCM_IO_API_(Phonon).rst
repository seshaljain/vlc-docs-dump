== Abstract == Design a fully featured PCM I/O API for Phonon, and
provide an implementation for the Phonon-VLC backend and one other
(either Xine or GStreamer). This API will allow developers to capture
PCM data from devices like a sound card, or to play back raw audio from
memory, or elsewhere. This will provide some important missing features
in Phonon, and open the door for many applications waiting to make use
of an API like this.
