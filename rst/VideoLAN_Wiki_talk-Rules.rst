Hurrah, at last some proper rules! It's pretty obvious stuff, but it's better to have rules we can point to and follow. Also added reditect for `rules <rules>`__ for ease of use.

The only one I don't quite get is *Don't say anything you can't say on TV* as that can be different in different countries. Perhaps it can have a bit of clarification: is it a ban on libel/slander (it'd be a good idea to warn against that), a ban on swearing (I don't think that'd be necesary, as if it's for causing offense it's covered by other rules, and if it's random it's covered by nonsense), or something else? --`H2g2bob <User:H2g2bob>`__ 20:46, 27 June 2006 (CEST)

WikiMedia is not MediaWiki
--------------------------

The sentence:

   *Check the general WikiMedia Syntax that you can use on this wiki*

should read

   *Check the general*\ **MediaWiki**\ *Syntax that you can use on this wiki*.
