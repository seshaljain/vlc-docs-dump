==Project Abstract== :The main goal of this project will be giving
VideoLAN a Lua framework to load scriptable services discovery, to make
them easier to write, if they don't require C complexity. :Second goal
will be giving VideoLAN access to a great number of online music and
video services, like Jamendo, Magnatune, youtube, Dailymotion, etc...,
using the new Lua modules.

==Timeline== {\| class="wikitable" Study lua, vlc source '''Coding
begins''' Code the lua framework, make sure it works... UI integration
'''Mid-term evaluation''' Code the services discovery '''"Pencil
down"''' '''Final evaluation''' '''Submitting required code samples to
Google''' \|} The planning is still a little vague, i still don't know
examination dates, so it's just a guess, but i don't think to have big
problems on working during that period (probably just a break the day of
the exam or the day before...)

==Current Status==

===Git===

You can checkout to my repository by:
   $ git clone git://git.videolan.org/vlc-sephiroth87.git

Remember to switch to branch "work".

===Right now?=== Studying lua, jpeg sample code...
