I am confused as to how to get VLC to load the [[gme]] plugin. I've
tried looking at the help (-h) and long help (-H) to try and figure out
how to load gme. Gme is not in my list of plugins available (-l) but I
cannot find how to load it in.

Please help us find out how to load [[Gme]] in, and if it's small
perhaps have it as one of the default codecs within VLC?

A few people are having trouble, here's a forum message on the topic as
well here--Pareto
