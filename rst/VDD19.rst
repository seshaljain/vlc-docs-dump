{{VDD}} [[Image:Vdd2019.png500px|]] = Welcome to Video Dev Days 2019 =

The [[VideoLAN]] non-profit organization is happy to invite you to the
multimedia open-source event of the fall!

For its eleventh edition, people from the VideoLAN and open source
multimedia communities will meet in '''Tokyo''' to discuss and work on
the future of the open-source multimedia community.

This is a very technical conference, focused on low-level multimedia.

== Who can come? ==

Literally every one is invited to VDD, we just need registration for
legal reason ''(to enter the building)''.

This is a technical conference, focused on low-level multimedia, like
codecs and their implementations like '''x264''' or '''dav1d''',
frameworks like '''FFmpeg''' or '''Gstreamer''' or playback libraries
like '''libVLC'''.

Things like Javascript video frameworks or ad-injection frameworks would
be considered out of scope.

The price to enter is totally '''Free'''.

== Sponsorship for Japan ==

Since '''Japan''' is a bit further than the usual conferences, often in
Europe, going to Japan is more expensive.

If you want [[VideoLAN]] to sponsor your trip, you should read the
[[VDD19/Sponsor_Policy|Sponsorship Policy]].

== Traveling to Japan ==

You should consider staying a bit longer to '''Japan''', if you can
afford a few extra days. Kyoto is amazing!

You should take care of your passport and, if applicable, your visa very
quickly!

See the dedicated page: [[VDD19/Traveling_Advice|traveling advice for
Japan]].

You might want to consider to '''offset your carbon footprint'''.<br />

== Transportation ==

-  Get a Japanese electronic [[#Electronic_payments|payment card]] to
   travel easily on the public transports.
-  Check the dedicated page for [[VDD19/Air
   travel#Airport_transfer|airport transfers]].

\* For routing, you can use the following services: {\|
class="wikitable" !Vendor !Website !Google Play !Apple App Store Hitachi
Hyperdia
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hyperdia.android.activity
here] - -[https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1230367186?mt=8 here]
\|} '''NOTE''': VideoLAN does not refund taxi, car rental and public
transport.

=== Rail pass === If you have a voucher for a rail pass, you should save
it for before or after the conferencing days. JR passes are of limited
within central Tokyo. They are valid for the ''Yamanote'' loop and the
''Chuo-Sobu'' east-west transverse train lines, as well as JR-operated
buses, but not on the metro networks.

== Means of payment ==

VISA and MasterCard cards are '''not''' universally accepted in Japan.

=== Cash === You will need to withdraw cash from an ''international''
ATM (accepting VISA, MasterCard, AmEx, Discovery and UnionPay). You can
find those: \* at arrivals in the airport terminal, \* at
'''[https://www.sevenbank.co.jp/intlcard/index2.html 7-Eleven]'''
convenience stores, \* at
'''[https://www.family.co.jp/for_tourist/en.html Family Mart]'''
convenience stores, \* and during office hours in Japanese Post offices.
Do not bother with the local banks ATMs, most of which do not accept
overseas cards. To be on the safe side, you could exchange a few tens of
thousands of yens in advance. Compare prices and avoid the extortionate
bureaux de change at airports!

=== Electronic payments ===

For small day-to-day purchases, you should procure a FeliCa electronic
payment card, a.k.a. an ''IC'' card. It can be used to enter and exit
public transports (train, metro, bus, etc), to check out at convenience
stores and many shops. You can load the card with Japanese bank notes at
dedicated machines. There are two options in Tokyo area:

{\| class="wikitable" !Vendor !Regular card !Tourist card !Tourist point
of sale [https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/suica.html Suica]<br/>¥500
deposit JR East Travel Service Center
[https://www.pasmo.co.jp/visitors/en/normalpasmo/ Pasmo]<br/>¥500
deposit *Keisei at Narita airport*\ Keikyu at Haneda airport \|} Tourist
cards with their cutesy design are meant to keep as memento and provide
third-party discounts. But beware that they expire after 28 days
(including any unused credit).

== Electricity == Japan has the lowest household voltage in the world,
so '''check the specifications''' on your power adapters. Outlets are
not compatible with European or Commonwealth plugs. North American
''grounded'' plugs (with 3 pins) are also troublesome. Most attendees
will thus need passive adapters. They are easier to find at home, so
'''BUY BEFORE DEPARTURE'''. {\| class="wikitable" !Voltage -!Frequency
-!Socket }

== Connectivity ==

The telephone prefix for Japan is '''+81'''.

=== Mobile data === You can buy, or better yet pre-order, a prepaid data
SIM card at international arrivals at the airport. Don't postpone, as it
might be difficult to find elsewhere.

=== Wireless LAN === Free Wi-Fi access points are common, but they may
need registration, possibly in Japanese only. There is a map of known
Wi-Fi access points in the '''JNTO''' app (see [[#Transportation]]).

=== Group Chat === Participants can share information and discuss using
the dedicated [https://t.me/joinchat/GIwXP1WmM84pbxCXStaUew VDD 2019
Telegram group].

== Emergency ==

'''119''' is the fire and ambulance emergency number in Japan. '''110'''
is the local police number.

Please carry your travel insurance card or certificate on you at all
times. If you do not have a travel insurance yet, buy a fixed-term one
before you depart. EU social security cards are not '''not''' valid in
Japan. Advise your relatives, and if applicable, your government: \*
[https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fildariane/dyn/public/login.html
Registration for French citizens].

Personal safety risks in Japan primarily stem from natural disasters: \*

tips] \*\* on
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.rcsc.safetyTips.android

\* In case of earthquake: \*\* Seek cover (e.g. under a table) if
indoors, \*\* Get away from structures (especially glass windows) if
outdoors. \*\* After the quake, get away from the shore onto high ground
away from tidal waves. \* In case of typhoon, follow instructions from
authorities. Typhoon are predicted several days ahead.
