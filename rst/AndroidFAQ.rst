This page contains a list of common questions and problems (FAQ) that
users have about the [[Android]] port of {{VLC}}.

==General==

===VLC is not available in my country===

Sorry, it is possible that VLC is not available on the Play Store for
your country.

But you can also install VLC by yourself from an APK package. See the
[[Documentation:Android|Android Documentation]].

===VLC is not compatible with my device=== On the Google Play Store, VLC
for Android is only available in two versions, depending on your
device's processor: ARMv7 (and above) or Intel x86.

But you can find other versions [http://nightlies.videolan.org/ here],
such as ARMv6.

===Is Chormecast supported?=== No, Chromecast is not yet supported, but
we are working on it.

===Is there a easy way to play remote files stored on my Samba server
(or something equivalent)?=== Not for now, but we are working on it.

===I'm having problems with HD videos, such as freezing or lagging=== We
still have some issues with HD videos and we are working on performance,
but have you tried to modify the performance preferences? :*Force video
chroma: set to YUV :*\ Deblocking filter settings: adjust the level
:*Hardware accelerated decoding: enable

Try each option one by one until you find a configuration that works for
you.

===Hardware acceleration doesn't work on my device=== Sorry, hardware
acceleration may not work with all devices.

===I can't find a specific feature===

The best way to make a suggestion is to create a 'feature request'
ticket on the [https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ VLC ticket tracker].

===I found a bug=== That's great! Please read [[Android_Report_bugs|the
Android bug reporting guide]] and help us.

===When will the final version come?=== Probably one day... but the
current version already works pretty well for most purposes.
