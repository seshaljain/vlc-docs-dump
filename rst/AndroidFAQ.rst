On the Google Play Store, VLC for Android is only available in two versions, depending on your device's processor: ARMv7 (and above) or Intel x86.

But you can find other versions `here <http://nightlies.videolan.org/>`__, such as ARMv6.

No, Chromecast is not yet supported, but we are working on it.

Is there a easy way to play remote files stored on my Samba server (or something equivalent)?

Not for now, but we are working on it.

I'm having problems with HD videos, such as freezing or lagging

We still have some issues with HD videos and we are working on performance, but have you tried to modify the performance preferences?

:*Force video chroma: set to YUV

:*Deblocking filter settings: adjust the level

Try each option one by one until you find a configuration that works for you.

Sorry, hardware acceleration may not work with all devices.
