Horrible look and not supported SSA and ASS subtitles
=====================================================

This was a known issue of VLC. Support is better in 1.1.9 or over.

If you still have issues check that the **libass** plugin is present, using the dialog or the command line.

If you are on `Linux <Linux>`__, check that your maintainer has compiled the libass support in VLC.
