= Horrible look and not supported SSA and ASS subtitles =

This was a known issue of VLC. Support is better in {{VLC}} 1.1.9 or
over.

If you still have issues check that the '''libass''' plugin is present,
using the dialog or the command line.

If you are on [[Linux]], check that your maintainer has compiled the
libass support in VLC.
