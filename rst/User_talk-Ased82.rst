Hi.

This wiki own VLC documentation. It is not a platfeform where somebody will answer such questions. You should visit the `forum <http://forum.videolan.org>`__ or the `IRC <irc://freenode.net#videolan>`__ (freenode.net, #videolan).

(you should also check you have ticked VLC ActiveX during VLC install)
