Graphical and command-line approaches are both possible. For all methods both decimals and width:height values may be given, so a fullscreen `aspect ratio <aspect_ratio>`__ would be accepted as both 4:3 and 1.33 (lists of popular aspect ratios: `Widescreen.org <https://widescreen.org/aspect_ratios.shtml>`__ and `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)>`__).

For the `Qt Interface <Qt_Interface>`__: In the menu bar select **Tools** → **Preferences** → **Video** → **Force Aspect Ratio**.

As described in `Documentation:Command line#Video_options <Documentation:Command_line#Video_options>`__ ``--aspect-ratio`` can be given on the command-line. Unlike the graphical approach, this will not modify settings permanently.
