<noinclude>{{Howto|Change the aspect ratio of videos}}</noinclude>

<onlyinclude>Graphical and command-line approaches are both possible.
For all methods both decimals and width:height values may be given, so a
fullscreen [[aspect ratio]] would be accepted as both 4:3 and 1.33
(lists of popular aspect ratios:
[https://widescreen.org/aspect_ratios.shtml Widescreen.org] and
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image) Wikipedia]).

For the [[Qt Interface]]: In the menu bar select '''Tools''' →
'''Preferences''' → '''Video''' → '''Force Aspect Ratio'''.

As described in [[Documentation:Command line#Video_options]]
<code>--aspect-ratio</code> can be given on the command-line. Unlike the
graphical approach, this will not modify settings
permanently.</onlyinclude><noinclude> {{VSG}} [[Category:GNU GPL
