`Autodesk Animator <Wikipedia:Autodesk_Animator>`__ **FLIC** animations, also known as **FLC** or **FLI** animations, are a sequence of 256 colour bitmaps shown in sequence, similar to a `GIF <GIF>`__. To save space, only the pixels changed since the last image are stored in the new image. (There may also be `RLE <RLE>`__ compression in there, I can't remember).

FLC files are mainly used in some types of computer games, due to the ability to draw FLC files very quickly and compatibility with some `libraries <libraries>`__, such as `Allegro <http://alleg.sourceforge.net>`__. Elsewhere, they are not common due to the low quality image (from the 256 colours) and low compression rates.

Programs like `aseprite <https://www.aseprite.org/>`__ can create and edit these files easily.
