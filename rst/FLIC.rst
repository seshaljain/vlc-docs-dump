[[Wikipedia:Autodesk Animator|Autodesk Animator]] '''FLIC''' animations,
also known as '''FLC''' or '''FLI''' animations, are a sequence of 256
colour bitmaps shown in sequence, similar to a [[GIF]]. To save space,
only the pixels changed since the last image are stored in the new
image. (There may also be [[RLE]] compression in there, I can't
remember).

FLC files are mainly used in some types of computer games, due to the
ability to draw FLC files very quickly and compatibility with some
[[libraries]], such as [http://alleg.sourceforge.net Allegro].
Elsewhere, they are not common due to the low quality image (from the
256 colours) and low compression rates.

Programs like [https://www.aseprite.org/ aseprite] can create and edit
these files easily.
