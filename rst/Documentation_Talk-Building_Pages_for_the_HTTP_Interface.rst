Undocumented RPN operators
--------------------------

`Teyut <User:Teyut>`__ 19:38, 15 April 2007 (CEST): I've added informations about some RPN operators using the source code in *rpn.c*. However, I didn't test them all, and especially, I'm not sure how **vlc_get_meta** and **snapshot** works, and I have no clue what **vlm_command** and **services_discovery_\*** commands are made for. So if someone can confirm what I've written, and give a better example for **vlm_command**, it would be better I think.

   Thanks for the help! The descriptions look ok. (except the VLM example which is kind of not using a VLM command, but I'll fix it) `Dionoea <User:Dionoea>`__ 21:59, 15 April 2007 (CEST)

Updated RPN: examples?
----------------------

I fixed some wiki formatting on the RPN section, but it really needs an example or two to explain how RPN works, say an example of seeking forward 20 seconds? --`Gth <User:Gth>`__ 18:26, 23 April 2012 (CEST)
