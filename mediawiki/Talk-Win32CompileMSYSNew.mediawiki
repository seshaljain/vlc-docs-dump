The links to update autoconf, automake, and libtool seem incorrect - they install into /usr/local and contain executables named with the version number (as in 'autoconf-2.61').  The MSYS versions seem to work better, as in:
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS%20System%20Builder/autoconf-2.61-MSYS-1.0.11-1.tar.bz2/download
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS%20System%20Builder/automake-1.10-MSYS-1.0.11-1.tar.bz2/download
* http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS%20System%20Builder/libtool1.5-1.5.25a-20070701-MSYS-1.0.11-1.tar.bz2/download

(Fixed)

When I installed msys, from the msys prompt, /usr/ is equivalent to C:\msys\1.0\, so wherever you see jb refer to  /usr/win32/, I had to use only /win32/

(noted)

I also needed to get and build a recent x264 snapshot (latest trunk needs >0.76).

*'''Fix libtool search dirs''', seem incorrect.

What looks incorrect? Did it cause failures? (I think it just looks odd but is right) [[User:Rogerdpack|Rogerdpack]] 21:27, 21 September 2010 (UTC)
