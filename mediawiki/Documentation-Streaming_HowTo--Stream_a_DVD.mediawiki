Note: Under Unix/Linux, you must have write access to the device corresponding to your DVD drive. For that, you should be in the ''disk'' or ''cdrom'' group (look at the permissions in '''/dev'''). If you're not, add yourself to the group:
 [[terminal|#]] adduser your_login disk_or_cdrom
and then restart your session.

== Stream a DVD with VLC ==

 {{%}} vlc -vvv --color dvdsimple:/dev/dvd --sout udp://192.168.0.12 --ttl 12 --sout-all
where:
*'''/dev/dvd''' is the name of your DVD drive (put '''D:''' under Windows if '''D''' is the letter of your DVD drive) or the directory where you copied your DVD,
*'''192.168.0.42''' is either:
**the IP address of the machine you want to unicast to;
**or the DNS name the machine you want to unicast to;
**or a multicast IP address.
*'''12''' is the value of the TTL (Time To Live) of your IP packets (which means that the stream will be able to cross 11 routers).
*'''sout-all''' allows you to stream all soundtracks and subtitles

If you want to stream the DVD continuously, add the '''--loop''' option.
