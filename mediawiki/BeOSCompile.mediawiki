Compile VLC on BeOS

== Required tools ==
You need :
* [http://www.bebits.com/app/2680 BeOS 5] with development tools
* [http://www.bebits.com/app/1610 CVS 1.11]
* Git
* [http://www.bebits.com/app/3218 bzip2/bunzip2]
* [http://www.bebits.com/app/2848 wget]
* [http://www.bebits.com/app/4011 gcc 2.95.3]

Compiling is usually done on a vanilla R5.0.3 install with gcc 2.95.3. 

Building with older compilers won't work. 

Building on a BONE-enabled install probably doesn't work at the moment.

== Build VLC ==
Now you can compile vlc:

=== Get the source ===
Download the {{VLC}} [[GetTheSource|source code]] (using [[Git]]) as described on the [[GetTheSource| "Get the source"]] page.

=== Build external libs ===

We now need to build the [[Contrib_Status| 3rd party libs]]. For that, you will need to:
* cd to the source directory with your Terminal application.
* cd to extras/contrib/ subdir of VLC and execute <code>./bootstrap</code>
* Now execute <code>make src</code>. This will download and compile all the required external libraries and programs that {{VLC}} needs (you need an internet connection, a fast one preferably).

=== Prepare the VLC build ===
Now we return to VLC itself. Go back to the top level VLC source directory. If you use Git (which you really should), then run <code>./bootstrap</code>. 

This will create configure and Makefiles for {{VLC}} (snapshots and releases already include this).

=== Configure VLC ===
The next step is to configure, in the top level VLC source directory.

<code>./configure --enable-debug --enable-sout --enable-httpd --enable-vlm --enable-dvdread --enable-dvdnav --enable-dvbpsi --enable-screen --enable-ogg --enable-mkv --enable-mad --enable-ffmpeg --enable-faad --enable-a52 --enable-flac --enable-libmpeg2 --enable-vorbis --enable-speex --enable-theora --enable-freetype --enable-fribidi --disable-skins2 --with-ffmpeg-mp3lame --with-ffmpeg-faac --with-ffmpeg-zlib --disable-x11 --disable-hal --disable-daap --disable-xvideo --disable-glx --disable-sdl --disable-wxwindows</code>

=== Build VLC ===
After configure is finished, we can finally build {{VLC}}. A simple <code>make</code> will do the trick.

To build a package, run <code>make package-beos</code>.
