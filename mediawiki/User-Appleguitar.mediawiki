Appleguitar is my code name.  My real name is Duncan Chan, from Vancouver BC, Canada.

== Introduction ==

I am very much interested in the VLC project and taking part in Google SoC 2008.  There are a lot of cool project ideas from the VideoLAN wiki page, and they all seem very challenging, which is good.  It provides a lot of opportunities to learn and code, which is what SoC is all about.
