* [[Documentation:Modules/http_intf#VLC_2.0.0_and_later|Start VLC on the server with the Web Interface]].
* Type the IP address (or URL) of the host in the location field (address bar). You may need to specify the port (VLC defalts to using port 8080)
*: An example is http://127.0.0.1:8080 - 127.0.0.1 refers to the local machine.
* If you want to control VLC from a computer that is not the one running VLC then you will need to enable access in the .hosts file (from 0.9.6 onwards)
* Add the files to be streamed to the playlist like /home/file.mpg (unless you use the UI to select the file in the next step)
* Add streaming destination to the server in the sout field udp://<client>:1234, using these steps in the UI:
**Go to File -> Open File
**Click Browse to select the file you want to play
**Select Stream/Save and click Settings
**Optional: Select Play Locally to make sure everything is working correctly
**Select UDP and fill in the client IP address and port number (default: 1234)
**Click OK, OK, and press play
* Open VLC on the client to receive the video stream, in one of two ways:
**At the terminal, with '''vlc udp://@:1234'''
**Start up VLC normally
***Go to File -> Open network stream...
***Leave the default options (Radio button UDP selected, port set to 1234)
***Press OK

Note: the VLC Web Interface does not have an option to adjust the server's input stream. Direct to the host is required for changing the input media.
