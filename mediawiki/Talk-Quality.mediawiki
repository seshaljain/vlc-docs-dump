I would suggest listing the testfiles up on the Wiki-page and numbering them. Maybe include advance features like videofilters, special outputs, the used acess-module and/or even the whole vlcrc configuration file.
When someone encounters a problem in QA he/she could refer to 'Test 1' or 'Test A' or something that describes the setup and settings.

I think this page is outdated, it should be removed or updated, but I don't really know what to put here... [[User:Berthe|berthe]] 11:29, 18 June 2010 (UTC)
