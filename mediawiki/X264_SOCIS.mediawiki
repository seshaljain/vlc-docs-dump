== Plans==
First of all x264 is profiled (this has been done and a link to the profiles are below) 

<br> 

=== Profiles  ===
[[X264 SOCIS/profiles]]

<br> 

=== Conversions  ===
Functions that are normally C that are intended for asm will have NEON implementations by the end of the project Every DSP function will also have a NEON implementation 

<br> 

=== List of functions to be implemented in NEON  ===
{{SERVER}}/X264_SOCIS/todo

== Timeline  ==
<u>August 1st - 14th:</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Learn ARM architecture and ARM assembly 

<u>August 15th - 21st:</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Start learning NEON while writing NEON functions

<u>August 22nd - Onwards:</u>&nbsp; Move onto harder functions''<br>'' 

<u>Project end date:</u>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 28th October 2011 

<br> 

''List will be updated shortly''

== Progress  ==
My progress to date: 

*Learned ARM assembly
