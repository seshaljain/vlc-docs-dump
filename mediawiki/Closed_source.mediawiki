Closed source (also known as proprietary software) is a way to licence software. It is the opposite of [[open source]]. This type of software usually forbids:
* Examining the source code (computer code)
* Modifying the program
* Redistributing the program
A closed source license may place arbitrary restrictions on the program, including [[DRM]], [[copy prevention]], and planned obsolescence. Users are not in control of this type of software.
