This page contains a list of common questions and problems (FAQ) that users have about the [[Android]] port of {{VLC}}.

==General==

===VLC is not available in my country===

Sorry, it is possible that VLC is not available on the Play Store for your country.

But you can also install VLC by yourself from an APK package. See the [[Documentation:Android|Android Documentation]].

===VLC is not compatible with my device===
On the Google Play Store, VLC for Android is only available in two versions, depending on your device's processor: ARMv7 (and above) or Intel x86. 

But you can find other versions [http://nightlies.videolan.org/ here], such as ARMv6.

===Is Chormecast supported?===
No, Chromecast is not yet supported, but we are working on it.

===Is there a easy way to play remote files stored on my Samba server (or something equivalent)?===
Not for now, but we are working on it.

===I'm having problems with HD videos, such as freezing or lagging===
We still have some issues with HD videos and we are working on performance, but have you tried to modify the performance preferences?
:*Force video chroma: set to YUV
:*Deblocking filter settings: adjust the level
:*Hardware accelerated decoding: enable

Try each option one by one until you find a configuration that works for you.

===Hardware acceleration doesn't work on my device===
Sorry, hardware acceleration may not work with all devices.

===I can't find a specific feature===

The best way to make a suggestion is to create a 'feature request' ticket on the [https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ VLC ticket tracker].

===I found a bug===
That's great! Please read [[Android_Report_bugs|the Android bug reporting guide]] and help us.

===When will the final version come?===
Probably one day... but the current version already works pretty well for most purposes.
