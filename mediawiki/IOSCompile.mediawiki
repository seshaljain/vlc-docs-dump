== Development environment ==

To develop VLC for iOS, you need:
* OS X 10.10 Yosemite (or later)
* Latest Xcode version (version 6 works so far)
* A correct shell (we recommend iTerm2 and zsh)
* [http://cocoapods.org CocoaPods] (for dependency management)

== Get the source ==

We provide source code packages for every release. You can find the latest on our [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ios.html Download VLC for iOS website]. Older releases [http://download.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-iOS/ are also available].

== Build it ==

Install the dependencies
 
 pod update

Wait, and grab a coffee.

Open the VLC.xcworkspace and run!

== Deploy ==

Open the .xcworkspace (not .xcodeproj) in Xcode and click on Run.

Buliding release version needs code signing

Before running simulator in Xcode, run .sh with -s first;
Before running iphoneos in Xcode, run .sh without -s first.
