== Error in the documentation regarding subtitle track value ==
The documentation claims that in the input/codecs tab in preferences, setting the "subtitle track" value to "0" will disable subtitles by default. In actuality (as of VLC 2.1.5) a value of "-1" will disable subtitles.

Furthermore, it appears that the subtitle track number is not a boolean/toggle setting, but a ''relative index'' for the "Subtitle>Sub Track" selection menu; with "-1" corresponding to "Disable", "0" for the first subtitle-track, "1" for the second track, and so on...

I suppose it might be more intuitive if the values did start at "0", as then a "1" would correspond to subtitle track 1... but it appears that this setting instead adheres to the convention of "-1" to disable an option or feature.

At present, the doc is simply incorrect ;-)
