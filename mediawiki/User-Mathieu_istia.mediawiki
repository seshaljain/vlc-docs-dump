Hello! 


My name is '''Mathieu DUCAMP'''.
I'm a student of ISTIA at University of Angers in France ([http://www.istia.univ-angers.fr/ ISTIA]).


I work on a project for the company Actech called Recording. I work with the members of this site like [http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Thannoy Thannoy], [http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Remiii Remiii] and an other student of my school [http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Aurel_istia aurel_istia].

For my project, I begin in the VLC development, and I risk to have some questions and I hope you help me. Thank you.

You can see my advancement in my project [http://shiva.istia.univ-angers.fr/~adroch/index.php?page=suiviPj here] ,but it is in French (sorry!). 


See you!
