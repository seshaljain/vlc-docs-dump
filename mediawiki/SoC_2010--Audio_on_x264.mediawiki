== Abstract ==

Implement an audio filtering system that allows transcoding of audio with resampling, sample format conversion and channel remixing.

This is meant to be used for using with the soon-to-be-merged video filtering system for doing transcoding using only x264.
Is also a prerequisite for the planned --device option that will automatically downscale the video if needed, set the appropriate H.264 level options and transcode to the appropriate audio codec.

== Milestones ==

This list is preliminary.
