Administrators (also called "admins" or "sysops") are users of this wiki entrusted with powerful tools to help run the site.<br />
Below are a summary of the permissions of both standard users and administrators.

{{wikipedia|Wikipedia:Administrators}}


'''Regular users''' are able to:
* create pages
* edit pages
* rename pages
* clean up vandalism
* report other problems concerning the wiki to <span class="plainlinks">[{{fullurl:Special:ListUsers|group=sysop}} administrators listed here]</span>


'''Administrators''' are able to perform these actions as well as:
* edit otherwise restricted pages
* delete pages
** view or restore pages from the 'deleted pages' hidden archive
* combat vandalism
** quickly undo the most recent edits a single user has made to any page
** protect or un-protect pages depending on how often they are targeted for vandalism
** block users that vandalise repeatedly
** take further actions to combat spam and vandalism

At first glance this would appear to be an unfair distribution of power, but it's just the [[Wikipedia:Principle of least privilege|Principle of least privilege]]. Regular users are allowed to clean up vandalism and thereby protect the wiki, but administrators often concern themselves with dealing with spammers, abusive editors, and technical matters.<br />
Administrators still have to follow the rules of the community.
