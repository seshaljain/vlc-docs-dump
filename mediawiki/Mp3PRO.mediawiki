{{Wikipedia|mp3PRO}}

mp3PRO is a proprietary codec that is no longer maintained. Its goal was to supersede the [[mp3]] format with a better [[compression]] ratio that had comparable audio quality or better (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20150217185935/http://www.mp3prozone.com/basics.htm their archived site] for an introduction). It used [[wikipedia:spectral band replication|spectral band replication]] (SBR), which is [[lossy]] compression, but in a way indistinguishable to the human ear. The site seems to have vanished around 2015.
