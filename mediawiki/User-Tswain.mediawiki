Hi,
my name is Tony Swain and I am the owner of the HyperView project at...
                https://hyperview.dev.java.net/
HyperView is an extremely optimized '''AWT''' based graphics/nio single process non blocking select server API.  This means it runs at the same level as Swing, but it is much more optimized and inherently double buffered.
I am working ATM @ integrating VLC into HyperView, referred to as the "View."  HyperView is loosely based on Amiga Copper lists and runs either as a java application or verbatim as a secure signed java 2 Applet and it also encapsulates the comm API and is the only Applet that I know of that has control over the PC serial port, and I have used this in the past to for example control GPRS AT modems.
For more info on the View goto the previously mentioned web site.
