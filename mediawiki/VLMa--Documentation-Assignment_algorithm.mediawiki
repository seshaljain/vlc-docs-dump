= Orders assignment algorithm =

== Acknolegements ==

* Every adapter has a score. This score is 0 when VLMa starts and then gets incremented by 5 when the order handled by this adapter is broadcasted and decremented by 1 otherwise.

* The user can assign priorities to programs, so that a program with a higer priority is more likely to be broadcasted.

== Steps of the assignment ==

=== Grouping ===

Programs that can be handled by the same adapter (two DTT channels having the same frequency for example) are put together into what we call "Program groups".

=== Partitionment ===

Not every adapter can read a given program group. So the first step si to put together adapters and program groups by affinity, DVB-T adapters with DTT program groups, stream channels with stream program groups, or DBV-S adapters bound to satellite XXX with Satellite program groups whose media is bound to XXX.

=== Assignment ===

For each partition, adapters are then sorted by score and program groups by priority (the priority of a group being the sum of the priorities of its programs).

Then the first program group is assigned to the first adapter, the 2nd program group with the 2nd adapter, etc.
