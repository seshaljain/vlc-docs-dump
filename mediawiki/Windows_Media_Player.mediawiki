== Common Issues ==
=== MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 playback ===

Microsoft® does not bundle [[codec]]s for [[MPEG-2]] or [[MPEG-4]] with Windows and recommends purchasing them as part of a "DVD decoder pack" from a third-party vendor.

The symptom associated with a missing codec is Windows Media Player displaying the cryptic "C00D11CD" error code immediately after opening an MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 coded file or stream.  At that point, you must purchase the appropriate codec, perhaps from Microsoft's® [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/plugins.aspx list of approved vendors].

=== Streaming from VLC ===
To date, the only option for streaming from VLC to Windows Media Player is to:
* [[Transcode]] the file or feed into [[WMV]] format
* Encapsulate the transcoded stream in the [[ASF]] container format
* Use [[MMS]] or [[MMSH]] for the stream transport

{{forum|255}}.

Otherwise, Windows Media Player does not appear to support streaming for anything other than its proprietary formats.

<blockquote>''
"Windows Media Player 9 Series can play files in a wide variety of digital media file formats, but Windows Media Services 9 Series '''cannot stream all of those files'''. In certain cases, you may need to convert digital media files into a compatible format before you can stream them." [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/forpros/server/faq.aspx#2_3]
''</blockquote>

Streaming to Windows Media Player over [[HTTP]] is supported, but the multimedia stream must be converted to a Microsoft-proprietary format with [[Windows Media Encoder]] beforehand. 

Streaming is known to work with Windows Media Player 9 or higher.  In particular, Windows Media Player 8 does not interoperate with VLC.  {{forum|5199}}
