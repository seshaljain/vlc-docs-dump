Help!

When I installed the vlc-0.8.6d-1.el4.rf.i386.rpm in Redhat ES release 4,following warning appeared:

I know that these warning means I should install these rpm packages before install vlc,but it is

a very hard work,I know I can use yum to install vlc automatic,but my redhat server is in 

internal network and can not connect internet directly.

Who can give me a advice.
