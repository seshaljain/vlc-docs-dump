I'm looking for information on how to use the vlc
Everytime I try to download a video or audio from like say for instance 'u'tube, the player plays the file but it doesn't get saved to my computer.
There usually is a file created but it will only have a file size of 400kb and when I click on it there is always an error msg that 'vlc can't play the file doesn't recognize file' etc...

"VLC can't recognize the input's format:
The format of 'file:///C:/Users/Public/Music/John%20Hammond%20Get%20Behind%20The%20Mule.mp4' cannot be detected. Have a look at the log for details."

Then I can't see the 'log'...

The instructions on the help pages are so cryptic and confusing.
And there is reference to a 'wizard' which I don't find...

What is up with all that?

Any help would be appreciated.

By the way, the vlc player works fine for files that are already on my computer...
And I like it for such!
I just wish I could download the files so I can learn the songs...

Thank You
KC
