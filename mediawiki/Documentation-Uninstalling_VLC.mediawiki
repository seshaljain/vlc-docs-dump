Drag the VLC application to your trash can. You can also remove the configuration file and the cache files in '''~/Library/Preferences/VLC/'''. There is an AppleScript on the disk-image which lets you do this automatically.

If that did not work, you can double-click on the ''Applications'' icon. This will bring up a list of all applications on your Mac. Scroll through the list of Applications, then press and hold the ''Ctrl'' button to bring up a table of options and actions. Click on "move to trash".

Finally, if the previous processes failed, you can try downloading a third-party uninstaller program to uninstall it, such as [http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/25276/appcleaner AppCleaner].
