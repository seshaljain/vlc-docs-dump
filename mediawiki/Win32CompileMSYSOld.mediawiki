MSYS/MinGW environment for Windows from http://developers.videolan.org/vlc/msys-compile.txt

=Introduction=
=MSYS/MinGW environment=

Setting up a working MSYS/MinGW environment requires the following:

* MSYS installation
* Updating MSYS
* MSYS DTK (Developer Tool Kit)
* Updating bash (shell)
* MinGW installation
* Configuration of fstab
* Creation of home folder

Note that the following generic resource locations were used to download the appropriate packages (and more recent versions might be obtained from here):

==Minimal SYStem (MSYS) installation==

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11-2004.04.30-1.exe

Perform a basic installation into C:\msys

Do not continue with the post install (this will be done later).


==Update MSYS==

Update MSYS to a more recent version

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11-20060807.tar.bz2

Extract the .tar.bz2 file, it contains the following files:

 mount.exe
 msys-1.0.dll
 ps.exe

Copy the files to:

 C:\msys\bin

This will overwrite/update the version(s) used in MSYS.


==MSYS DTK (Developer Tool Kit)==

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/msysDTK-1.0.1.exe

Perform a basic installation into C:\msys


==Updating BASH==

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/bash-3.1-MSYS-1.0.11-snapshot.tar.bz2

Extract the .tar.bz2 file, in the bin subfolder it contains the following files:

 bash.exe
 sh.exe

Copy the files to:

 C:\msys\bin

This will overwrite/update the sh.exe version used in MSYS


==MinGW==

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.0.3.exe

Select the download option.

Do not install with "Current" MinGW packages but select "Candidate".

Select the following components to install:

 MinGW base tools (autoselected)
 g++ compiler

Then installation will finish downloading automatically.

Run MinGW-5.0.3.exe again and select the download and install option to restart the installation. 

Selet "Candidate" still and select the same components to install.

Perform the installation into the default destination:

 C:\msys\mingw

The following versions (or possibly newer) of the candidate packages will be
downloaded and installed:

 mingw-runtime-3.10.tar.gz
 w32api-3.7.tar.gz
 binutils-2.16.91-20060119-1.tar.gz
 gcc-core-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz
 gcc-g++-3.4.5-20060117-1.tar.gz

(It is also possible to get these packages seperately and extract them to C:\msys\mingw)

==Configuring fstab==

The folder C:\msys\etc contains the following file:

 fstab.sample

Copy the file to:

 fstab

Open the file with a text editor and change the path value for the mingw mount point from:

 c:/mingw to c:/msys/mingw

Save the file.


==Starting MSYS==

The first time MSYS is started, a "home" folder is created, for example:

 C:\msys\home\Administrator


=Installing additional packages=

The following packages are required for building VLC

* Wget
* Iconv
* Gettext
* MinGW utils
* Libtool
* Autoconf
* Automake
* Zip
* Coreutils


==WGet==

Wget is required for building from the "extras/contrib" or mingwPORT packages.

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/wget-1.9.1-mingwPORT.tar.bz2

Although this is a mingwPORT package it already has a precompiled wget on board.

Extract the .tar.bz2 file. It contains the following file in the bin subfolder:

 wget.exe

Copy the file to:

 C:\msys\mingw\bin


==Iconv (GNU libiconv)==

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/libiconv-1.8.0-2003.02.01-1.exe

Perform a basic installation into the default destination Folder

 C:\msys\mingw


===Updating Iconv===

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/libiconv-1.10-mingwPORT.tar.bz2

Extract the .tar.bz2 file. Copy the contents into your home folder in MSYS

 C:\msys\home\Administrator (example)

Start the MSYS shell and do the following commands:

 cd libiconv-1.10-mingwPORT/libiconv-1.10/mingwPORT

 mkdir -p /usr/src/libiconv-1.10

 ./mingwPORT.sh 

Follow the default installation.

If all went well all the appropriate libraries should be installed/built and placed into c:/msys/mingw/lib.

NOTE: For some unknown reason usage of Iconv fails when 1.10 is installed directly without having installed 1.8.0.


==Gettext==

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/gettext-0.16.1-1-bin.tar.bz2
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/gettext-0.16.1-1-dll.tar.bz2

Untar both of these packets and copy the files in the subdirectories under gettext-0.16.1-1-bin/usr/local and gettext-0.16.1-1-dll/usr/local to the corresponding subdirectories under C:\msys\mingw.
For example:
       copy gettext-0.16.1-1-bin/usr/local/lib/*.* to  C:\msys\mingw\lib\
       copy gettext-0.16.1-1-dll/usr/local/bin/*.* to  C:\msys\mingw\bin\
      ......................................................
Note:
   The latest VLC from svn requires gettext-0.16.xx to build.

==MinGW Utils==

The unix2dos tool from this package is required during the "make package" process of VLC for some conversion of txt files.

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/mingw-utils-0.3.tar.gz

Extract the .tar.gz file. it contains the following file in the bin subfolder:

 unix2dos.exe

Copy the file to:

 C:\msys\mingw\bin


==Libtool==

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/libtool-1.5.22-mingwPORT.tar.bz2

Extract the .tar.bz2 file. Copy the contents into your home folder in MSYS

 C:\msys\home\Administrator (example)

Start the MSYS shell and do the following commands:

 cd libtool-1.5.22-mingwPORT/libtool-1.5.22/mingwPORT

 mkdir -p /usr/src/libtool-1.5.22

 ./mingwPORT.sh 

Follow the default installation.

If all went well all the appropriate libraries should be installed/built and placed into c:/msys/mingw/lib.


==Autoconf==

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/autoconf-2.59-mingwPORT.tar.bz2

Extract the .tar.bz2 file. Copy the contents into your home folder in MSYS

 C:\msys\home\Administrator (example)

Start the MSYS shell and do the following commands:

 cd autoconf-2.59-mingwPORT/autoconf-2.59/mingwPORT

 mkdir -p /usr/src/autoconf-2.59

 ./mingwPORT.sh 

Follow the default installation.

If all went well all the appropriate libraries should be installed/built and placed into c:/msys/mingw/lib.


==Updating autoconf from contrib==

VLC 0.8.6 and later (including 0.9.0 svn/development) require an autoconf version
of 2.60 or greater.

If during the configure process the following msg appears it's time to update:

 "Hey, your autoconf is quite old. Update it".

Open your MSYS shell:

 cd vlc-trunk/extras/contrib

 ./bootstrap

 cd src

 make .autoconf


==Automake==

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/automake-1.9.5-mingwPORT.tar.bz2

Extract the .tar.bz2 file. Copy the contents into your home folder in MSYS

 C:\msys\home\Administrator (example)

Start the MSYS shell and do the following commands:

 cd automake-1.9.5-mingwPORT/automake-1.9.5/mingwPORT

 mkdir -p /usr/src/automake-1.9.5

 ./mingwPORT.sh 

Follow the default installation.

If all went well all the appropriate libraries should be installed/built and placed into c:/msys/mingw/lib.


==Zip==

.mp4 output support when building the x264 library.

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/zlib-1.2.3-mingwPORT-1.tar.bz2

Extract the .tar.bz2 file. Copy the contents into your home folder in MSYS

 C:\msys\home\Administrator (example)

Start the MSYS shell and do the following commands:

 cd zlib-1.2.3-mingwPORT/zlib-1.2.3/mingwPORT

 mkdir -p /usr/src/zlib-1.2.3

 ./mingwPORT.sh 

 Follow the default installation.

==Updating SDL from mingwPORT (optional)==

SDL support is required when building ffplay from the FFmpeg package.

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/SDL-1.2.8-mingwPORT.tar.bz2

Extract the .tar.bz2 file. Copy the contents into your home folder in MSYS

 C:\msys\home\SDL-1.2.8-mingwPORT (example)

Start the MSYS shell and do the following commands:

 cd SDL-1.2.8-minwPORT/SDL-1.2.8/mingwPORT

 mkdir -p /usr/src/SDL-1.2.8

 ./mingwPORT.sh 

Follow the default installation.

If all went well all the appropriate libraries should be installed/built and placed into /usr/local/lib.


===Updating SDL (optional)===

http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.11.tar.gz

Extract the .tar.gz file. Copy the contents into your home folder in MSYS

 C:\msys\home\SDL-1.2.11 (example)

Start the MSYS shell and do the following commands:

 cd SDL-1.2.11

 ./configure

 make

 make install

If all went well all the appropriate libraries should be installed/built and placed into /usr/local/lib.


==Nasm (optional)==

The Netwide assembler (nasm) is required for building the x264 library.

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=6208

Download the latest win32 binaries:

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/nasm/nasm-0.98.39-win32.zip?download

Extract the .zip. It contains the following file in the bin subfolder:

 nasmw.exe

Rename the file to nasm.exe and copy it to the following location:

 C:\msys\mingw\bin


==GPAC (optional)==

GPAC is required for building the x264 library with mp4 output support.

Start the MSYS shell and do the following commands:

 cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@gpac.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gpac co -P gpac

This will download the latest GPAC version from CVS.

 cd gpac

 ./configure

 make install-lib

TODO: copy GPAC files to appropriate folder automagically.

==x264 (optional)==

Start the MSYS shell and do the following commands:

 svn co svn://svn.videolan.org/x264/trunk x264-trunk

 cd x264-trunk

For generic purposes:

 ./configure

 make

For VLC:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr/win32

 make

 make install

This will copy the appropriate libs and .h to the prefix folder which will also be used by VLC for building the contrib

For compiling "stand-alone with mp4 output support" (this requires GPAC):

 ./configure --enable-mp4-output

 make

If you wish to compile FFmpeg stand-alone with x264 support then also do this

 make install

This will copy the appropriate libs and .h files to the default /usr/lib and /usr/include


==FFmpeg (optional)==

Start the MSYS shell and do the following commands:

 svn co svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg-trunk

 cd ffmpeg-trunk

For generic purposes:

 ./configure --enable-mingw32 --enable-memalign-hack \
    --enable-gpl --enable-pp

 make

For compiling with x264 support:

(This assumes you did a "make install" for x264 which will have copied the appropriate lib and .h files into lib/include).

 ./configure --enable-mingw32 --enable-memalign-hack \
    --extra-cflags=-I/usr/local/include \
    --extra-ldflags=-L/usr/local/lib \
    --enable-gpl --enable-pp --enable-x264

 make

For compiling into VLC:

(This does not need x264 lib in FFmpeg since VLC uses that directly, also prefix and extra flags are used to point to the "contrib" folder):

 ./configure --enable-mingw32 --enable-memalign-hack \
    --extra-cflags=-I/usr/win32/include \
    --extra-ldflags=-L/usr/win32/lib \
    --prefix=/usr/win32 \
    --enable-faac --enable-mp3lame --enable-gpl --enable-pp

 make

 make install-libs install-headers

This will copy all the appropriate libs and .h files into usr/win32/include and lib so they can be used by VLC compilation.


=FAQ=

Various troubleshooting issues..


==Make .qt4 from extras/contrib==

Fails on:

 checking for libmpeg2.a in /home/Administrator/vlc-trunk/./extras/contrib/src/mpeg2dec... no
 configure: error: cannot cd to /home/Administrator/vlc-trunk/./extras/contrib/src/mpeg2dec

Workaround: configure with 
 
 --without-contrib


==Make package-win32-zip==

Fails on:

 sed -i 's%share/osdmenu%osdmenu%g' ./vlc-0.9.0-svn/osdmenu/*.cfg
 sed: invalid option -- i

Workaround: compile sed 4.09 (any newer versions fail to compile on missing alloca)

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/sed/sed-4.0.9.tar.gz

use the newer sed version in c:\msys\mingw\bin and rename the old one to sed3.exe or something

ONLY use the 4.09 sed to do a make package-win32-zip, it will fail to compile VLC source
(so after it finishes, you have to copy the old version back again).

So in conclusion:

 make package-win32-zip fails with sed 3.02 on -i
 make autoconf fails with sed 4.09 on -E
 sed 4.10+ requires glib
 glib requires pkgconfig but pkgconfig requires glib?!
