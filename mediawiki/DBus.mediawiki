== TODO for DBus integration ==

VLC implements [[DBus-spec]], a desktop-neutral document, that aims to be suitable for every Media Players.

=== Decide service behaviour ===

Could vlc be a on-demand startable service, would it be useful ?

We just have to create a /usr/share/dbus-1/org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer.service:

<syntaxhighlight lang="ini">
[D-BUS Service]

Name=org.freedesktop.MediaPlayer

Exec=/usr/bin/vlc -I dummy --control dbus
</syntaxhighlight>
