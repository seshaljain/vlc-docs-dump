My name is Philipp Weissenbacher, I'm a third semester cs student at the University of Vienna. My primary field of interest is HCI and i18n and to a lesser extent more technical things like coding.

I've joined the VideoLAN project like 2 years ago, but haven't been very active. I've been helping [[User:Fkuehne|Felix Kühne]] with the German translation and I'm trying to improve the wiki in as many ways I can.
Although still being a C++ newbie, I'm looking forward to contribute to VLC media player itself soon (especially to it's brand new [[Qt Interface]] to which I'm also fairly new).
From time to time I'm getting the latest nighties to see if everything (still) works fine on Windows.
See [[Special:Contributions/Materthron|my contributions]] if you're more curious.
