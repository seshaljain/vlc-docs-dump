Thanks to everyone who pays attention to my project. I received several letters concerning the idea and I see that it excites many people.
I am open to your suggestions.

== About the project ==
The goal is to add GUI to the Firefox plug-in “in order to have, in the web pages embedded mode, buttons to control VLC media player as in WMP or Youtube player”. Next step is to develop similar plug-in for Internet Explore. Also “a replacement for all preconfigured media players embedded in web pages” should be provided.
More detailed description (but a little bit outdated) can be found at the application information page http://code.google.com/soc/2008/videolan/appinfo.html?csaid=CD2BD85FF24811F4.

Requirements:
* toolbar at the bottom of the video drawing area
* toolbar vissible by default
* toolbar should be possible to disable by webdesigner with JS API.
* toolbar should not be autohiding (think users won't understand)
* toolbar should have nicely designed buttons
* toolbar should work under Firefox windows
* toolbar should work under Firefox linux
* toolbar should work under Mozilla windows?
* toolbar should work under Safari MacOS X (pdherbemont)
* toolbar should have same JS API on all browsers (IE/Firefox)
The idea is that we need to use native code to design it: <br>
On linux, there is already a code that uses libX11 to show a toolbar on top of the video. <br>
On windows, GDI is the way to go (as the demo shows it). <br>
On mac, well, :D <br>
There are two things to show: a toolbar and a left-click menu. <br>
Most of the code must be cross platform, except the drawing part, which means that controls should be common, and drawing may not be. <br>
For designers that design explicitely a page for VLC, they must be able to deactivate menu and toolbar. The JS to control that has to be the same on ActiveX and Netscape/Mozilla.

== Who I am ==
My name is Vladimir Belousov. I’m a third-year university student of Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (http://phystech.edu).

== Progress ==
Current desight of the toolbar:
[[Image:Toolbar.png]]

It has play/pause button, seek bar, volume control (it pops up a bar
like system volume control does), about button.

''I think that the toolbar should be extremely simple and have only a few controls like other players have, because it mustn't occupy much place on the screen and allow user to understand the functionality fast. But if someone wants extended functionality – this is where context menu comes to play.''

There are three operating modes:
* Always Show - the toolbar is always shown
* Auto Hide - the toolbar gets hidden when user moves mouse pointer out of the window
* Hidden - the toolbar is always hidden

== TODO ==
Here are my plans on near future:
* Port on Windows (approximately a few days)
* Extend GUI with hints/tips and context menu
* Fix bugs
* …

== Bugs :-( ==
If you noticed the bug, please, add that to this list.
I update [http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc-vbelousov.git my git] repo from time to time, so you can test the project state.

* FF вызывает NPP_SetWindow не в соответствии с документацией
