We should add a link from [[Win32CompileCygwin]] to this page. --[[User:David206|David206]] 16:27, 20 May 2008 (CEST)

== ranlib command added ==

I added this because in the contrib-20090121-win32-bin-gcc-3.4.5-only.tar.bz2 tarball one library (liblua.a) needed this ranlib.
In anycase it doesn't hurt to do it! -- [[User:Gozer|Gozer]] 10:47, 26 January 2009 (CET)

== Windows bz2 contrib ==

Note related to section "Installing the Win32 "contrib" package in Cygwin"

To uncompress a bz2 archive, isn't 'j' option needed by tar?
Like this:
 tar xjf contrib-20080702-win32-bin-gcc-4.2.1-sjlj-runtime-3.13-only.tar.bz2 -C /
