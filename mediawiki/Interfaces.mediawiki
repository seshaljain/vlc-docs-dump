Interfaces are the way you interact with {{VLC}}. Like anything else in VLC, they are modules, which allows for their interchangeability ([[#Using|see below]]).

== Main interfaces ==
VLC has four main graphical interfaces:
* The [[Qt Interface]] (qt) is the default interface on [[Linux]] and [[Windows]] starting with version 0.9.0.
: Used to be [[wxWidgets Interface]] (wx) before.
* The [[Skins|skins2 Interface]] is an interface where you can customize VLC's look (works on Linux and Windows).
* The [[macOS Interface]] is the default (and only) graphical interface on [[macOS]].
* The [[BeOS Interface]] is the default (and only) graphical interface on [[BeOS]].

== Full list ==
Besides the above main interfaces, VLC contains many more:
{|
|'''qt'''
| Current (>=0.9.0) default [https://www.qt.io/ Qt4] interface on [[Linux]] and [[Windows]].
|-
|'''wx'''
| Previous (<0.9.0) default [http://www.wxwidgets.org/ wxWidgets] interface on [[Linux]] and [[Windows]].
|-
|'''skins2'''
| Load VLC with a [[skin]]. (Linux and Windows only)
|-
|'''macosx'''
| Default [[Mac OS X]] interface.
|-
|'''minimal_macosx'''
| Minimal [[Mac OS X]] interface.
|-
|'''beos'''

|-
| '''http'''

|-
| '''gestures'''
| [[Mouse Gestures]], where you can control VLC by moving the mouse
|-
| '''rc''', '''ncurses''', '''telnet'''
| [[Console|Console Interfaces]], non-graphical interfaces.
|-
| '''showintf'''

|-
| '''hotkeys''' and '''joystick'''
| Control VLC with the keyboard/joystick (see [[HotKeys]]).
|-
| '''dummy'''
| Don't use an interface ([[HotKeys]] still available).
|}

== Listing the available interfaces ==

To get a list of available interfaces, running VLC with the <code>-l</code> option:
 {{%}} vlc -l
This also displays the [[muxers]] and [[encoders]]/[[decoders]] and puts it in a file called <code>vlc-help.txt</code>. On Linux, run
 {{%}} vlc -l | grep -iF interface
to display the interfaces.

== <span id="Using"></span> Using an interface ==

To run VLC with a different primary interface, use the following command:
 {{%}} vlc --intf ''name''
You can also use
 {{%}} vlc -I ''name''
You can also change the default in the [[Preferences]].

However, you can also launch more than one interface:
 {{%}} vlc --intf qt --extraintf sap,telnet,http
This will launch VLC with the default Qt interface, but will also launch the [[SAP]], [[telnet]] and [[web interface]] in addition to the Qt one. The default for this can also be changed in the preferences.

Note that if you only use the [[dummy]] interface, you won't be able to tell vlc to quit (except watching a video). You may have to break it manually with <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>; or use <code>vlc://quit</code> as the last item on the playlist.
