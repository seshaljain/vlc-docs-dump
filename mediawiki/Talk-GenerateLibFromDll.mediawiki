== Page name ==

The name of this page is not so good. At least it do not conform to other page names in which we use spaces.
Here are some rename proposals:
* generate lib from dll
* generate a libvlc.lib

NB: spaces in page names are converted to underscores (_) for their URL.
This is my opinion, what are your ideas? --[[User:Thannoy|Thannoy]] 13:44, 29 September 2009 (UTC)
