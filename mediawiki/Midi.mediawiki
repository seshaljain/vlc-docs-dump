Standard MIDI Files (SMF) contain sounds events that indicate the notes and instruments in a musical performance, but do not include the digital waveform of the audio.
They usually have the extension <tt>.mid</tt> or <tt>.midi</tt>.
To play a MIDI file, software has to synthesize the music, which usually requires reading digital samples of musical instruments from a large file.

{{VLC}} can play Standard MIDI File (.MID) and RIFF MIDI (.RMI) files since version 0.9.0.

Windows binary builds included MIDI support only in versions {{VLC}} from 1.1.0 through 2.0.8. Starting from version 2.1.0, support was dropped due to [https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/9486 security issues]. It was re-activated in VLC 3.0.0.

=== SoundFonts file ===
To playback MIDI files, you need a [[wikipedia:SoundFont|SoundFont]] file (with extension <tt>.sf2</tt>).
You can download them from either of these two places:

* http://www.schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php
* http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/fluidsynth/wiki/SoundFont

=== Configure SoundFont in VLC ===
You need to open VLC's preferences. The preferences window has two display modes called '''Simple''' and '''All'''. Choose the display mode called '''All''', then go to '''Input/Codecs''' > '''Audio codecs''' > '''FluidSynth'''. Then select the .sf2 file with '''Browse''' button and save the preferences with '''Save''' button.

=== Linux ===
If the '''FluidSynth''' codec is not shown in VLC's preferences, you have to install it as well as sound fonts.
E.g. on [[Ubuntu]] 18.04 and derivatives it is in the '''vlc-plugin-fluidsynth''' package, while the '''fluid-soundfont-gs''' and '''fluid-soundfont-gm''' packages install some sound fonts in <code>/usr/share/sounds/sf2</code>.
