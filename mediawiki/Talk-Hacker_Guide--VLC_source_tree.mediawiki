: ''ipkg/'' is a package distribution system used by some linux disrtibutions. I guess that this contains definition files for the packages.
: ''libs/'' containts the loader (win32 dmo codec loading on linx) and a SRTP library which RÃ©mi started recently.
: ''lxdialog/'' i don't have a clue
: ''python/'' isn't that related to the python bindings?
