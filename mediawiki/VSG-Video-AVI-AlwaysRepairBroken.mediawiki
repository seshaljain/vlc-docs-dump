== Always perform repair action  for broken AVI Files==

This can be done from '''Tools -&gt; Preferences''' (set '''Show Settings''' to'''All''') and'''Input / Codecs -&gt; Demuxers -&gt; AVI'''. 

Select the wanted action from '''Force index creation''' dropdown box. Ask is default (it will always ask what you want to do). 

'''Always fix''' tries to always fix AVI files and '''Never fix''' always starts the playback without fixing.

Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.
