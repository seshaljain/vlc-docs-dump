Hi there, 
 
  I had a look to your post related with cross-compiling VLC for Windows CE and i have encountered some problems when attemping to compile the new version. My problems are relationed with compiling the new version of mingw runtime (3.15.2) over Debian. Do you any experience on this?

   By the way, Great job! 

Thanks,

Hector.
