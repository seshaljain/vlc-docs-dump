{{Lowercase}}
The '''libVLC''' (VLC {{SDK}}) media framework can be embedded into an application to get multimedia capabilities.

Since VLC is based on libVLC, one should be able to have the same features that {{VLC}} has.

The libVLC media framework is already used by several applications; see [[LibVLC_Users|who uses libVLC?]]

== Documentation ==

Please refer to the [https://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc/doc/doxygen/html/group__libvlc.html Doxygen documentation], which is the reference documentation.

<u>''Make sure that the documentation matches the LibVLC version.''</u> (if not, you can build it from the source code)

Some further topics are covered here:

* [[LibVLC Memory Management]] explained: covers the basics on the <code>_new()</code>, <code>_retain()</code>, <code>_release()</code>.
* [[LibVLC Media List Management]] explained: covers the basics on setting up a playlist.
* [[GenerateLibFromDll|Generate a .lib for using libVLC on Windows]] (before libVLC 2.1.0)

== Compiling == 
To build LibVLC you need [[VLC source code]] and follow [[Compile_VLC|VLC compilation instructions]] since LibVLC it is directly shipped in VLC source code.<br />
You will find headers in vlc-src/include/vlc and libvlc.so binaries in the ''hidden'' folder vlc-src/lib/.libs.<br />
When using your custom LibVLC build you will need to define the environment variable <var>VLC_PLUGIN_PATH</var> pointing to VLC modules located in vlc-src/modules.
