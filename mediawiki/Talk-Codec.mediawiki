I commented the "" Use the "name" part in you vcodec=... commands "" text because I thought it was a note to editors.  The other two I added in case someone presses 'edit' on the section.  If it is being publicly displayed, I think a rewording is in order.  --[[User:Tonsofpcs|tonsofpcs]] 09:15, 17 January 2006 (CET)
