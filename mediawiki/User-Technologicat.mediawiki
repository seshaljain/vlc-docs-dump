My name is Juha Jeronen. Technically, I'm not an official VLC developer, but I subscribe to vlc-devel.

I designed and programmed the IVTC and Phosphor deinterlacers for VLC 2.0 (which was then VLC 1.2), with help from fenrir for the MMX inline assembly. I also refactored the deinterlacer module at that time.

I've updated the [[Deinterlacing|deinterlacer]] documentation on the wiki, and written a [[Hacker_Guide/Video_Filters/Deinterlace|hacker's guide for the deinterlacer]]. I've also written a [[Hacker_Guide/Video_Filters|hacker's guide for VLC's video filters in general]].

As of 2012-01-27, I maintain VLC's Finnish translation.
