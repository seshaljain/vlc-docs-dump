=== 95, 98, ME ===

You can install VLC on Windows 95, 98, or ME operating systems by using [http://kernelex.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page KernelEx].

=== 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 ===

==== Recommended ====

The normal and recommended way to install VLC on a Windows operating system is via the installer package.

'''Step 0: Download and launch the installer'''

Download the installer package from the [https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html VLC download page for Windows]. After you download the installer package, double click on the file to begin the install process. If you're using Windows Vista, 7, 8 or 10 and have UAC (User Account Control) enabled, the operating system may prompt you to grant VLC administrator permissions. Click '''Yes''' to continue the installation process.

'''Step 1: Select an installer language'''

Before you can continue, you must select the language that you want the installer to use to display information to you. After you select a language, click '''OK'''.

'''Step 2: Review the Welcome screen'''

The VLC installer recommends that you close all other applications before continuing the installation process. When you're ready to proceed with the installation process, click '''Next'''.

'''Step 5: Pick a location'''

Click '''Browse...''' to choose the destination installation folder. After you've identified the desired folder, click '''Install'''.

'''Step 7: Installation complete'''

Once installation is complete, you may choose to run VLC or read VLC's release notes. Click '''Finish''' to complete the installation process and close the installer.

==== Alternative ====

If you want to perform an unattended (or silent) installation of VLC, you can do so via a [[command-line interface]]. Type in "''filename''" /L="''languagecode''" /S. For example, the English installation would look something like '''vlc-2.0.1-win32.exe /L=1033 /S'''.

'''PowerShell'''

Installing VLC using PowerShell is as easy.

#Download the macOS package from the [https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html VLC macOS download page]. 
#Double-click on the icon of the package: an icon will appear on your Desktop, right beside your drives. 
#Open it and drag the VLC application from the resulting window to the place where you want to install it (it should be '''/Applications''').

'''A standard install without libdvdcss:'''
 {{prompt|root}} apt-get update
 {{prompt|root}} apt-get install vlc <optional extra components>

Or search for <code>vlc</code> with the graphical package manager you like best. It should be in the main Debian repository in the section ''Video software''. Additional plugins are available and most require manual selection, e.g. <code>vlc-plugin-access-extra</code>, <code>vlc-plugin-notify</code> and <code>vlc-plugin-jack</code>.

'''For a standard install with libdvdcss:'''

A simple install of the [[libdvdcss]] package can be found here: https://download.videolan.org/debian/stable/, but for future bug fixes add the following lines to your '''/etc/apt/sources.list''':
<syntaxhighlight lang="apt_sources">
 deb https://download.videolan.org/debian/stable stable main
 deb-src https://download.videolan.org/debian/stable stable main
</syntaxhighlight>

Then:
 {{prompt|root}} apt-get update
 {{prompt|root}} apt-get install vlc libdvdcss2 <optional extra components>

This will allow you to decrypt [[DVD]]s.

Adapted (annotated) from https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-redhat.html:

Red Hat/CentOS/Scientific Linux have almost the same setups (they're all derived from Red Hat). Red Hat and derivatives have [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#Quickstart different instructions] if EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) is not set up. Red Hat Network (RHN) users should verify that they have enabled the ''optionals'' and ''extras'' channels for RHN subscriptions.

If you want to have DVD playback ability, you will need to install the libdvdcss package too ([https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-redhat.html source]).
