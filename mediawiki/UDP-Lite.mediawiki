UDP-Lite is a protocol similar to [[UDP]] that delivers streams of data even if deemed "damaged". This may be useful in some noisy network environments where data may get lost. [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3828 RFC 3828] suggests UDP-Lite to be applicable for salvaging voice and video codecs, mentioning [[H.264]] and [[MPEG-4]] by name: this is because these and similar codecs already do integrity checks in the form of checksums. VLC has had UDP-Lite support (input RTP/AVP, output RTP) since 0.9.0.
