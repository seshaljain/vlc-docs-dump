Has anyone written a code for using Infrared Devices with VLC? I'd just love to be able to control  
VLC from accross the room.

== Why is the intf=none interface not mentioned? ==
Why is the intf=none interface not mentioned, it seems that if you want to use NO interface then 'none' is the best ('dummy' pops up a command line window for me on windows) is this just a windows thing? I've found it to be quite handy

:On my Linux, "-I dummy" do not show a command line interface and "-I none" give me an error, it can't find this interface module. Using vlc --list-verbose, I can only list those "interfaces" modules:
 % command line ~= vlc --list-verbose |grep -B 2 interface

== What's with the rick-roll in "FULL LIST"? ==
the sub section "full list" first entry has qt4 linked to a troll site... whoever created that link should be banned from ALL wiki's PERMANENTLY! no excuse for such vandalism... the site could inject a virus if it wanted to but looks like they're just making money at expense of people who click  --[[User:Qazwiz|the Great and Almighty qazwiz]] ([[User talk:Qazwiz|talk]]) 04:03, 16 June 2017 (CEST)
