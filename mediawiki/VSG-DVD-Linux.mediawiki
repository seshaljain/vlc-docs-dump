== DVDs wont play in Linux  ==

''This tip is only intended for Linux users who can't play any DVD.'' 

<br> 

Maybe you don't have the '''libdvdcss''' package, which you need if you want to play DVDs with VLC.<br>You can get the libdvdcss package [http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Libraries/libdvdcss-165.shtml here]. 

<br> 

You can try to check about you have the access rights for your DVD player.<br>Make sure you have access rigths to your DVD player. In linux, you can use chmod to edit access rights to your DVD block device: #chmod 666 /dev/dvd<br> 

Here /dev/dvd is the device corresponding to your DVD drive. 

<br> 

Make sure VLC knows where your DVD drive is located (/dev/dvd usually). 

Go to Settings&gt;Preferences&gt;Input/Codecs&gt;General and under "Default devices" make sure your dvd drive path is entered in the "Default DVD" box. 

<br> 

When you go to open a DVD, you should see something like "dvd:///dev/dvd" as the media resource locator in the "Open:" box near the top of the Open dialog. <br>
