== Discussion ==
We have a new QT4 interface and it needs to be in English.  Discuss any issues here.
* Check the English of all strings.  Fix it.  Have someone else do it again to be sure you didn't mess something up or make something too ambiguous.  
* There is no need to change error-output strings, as it is probably best that they remain in their original form so that they can still be found easily.  If you find any repeated error-outputs (same text for different events), inform a developer.  
* If you find any code being sent to stderr via fprintf(stderr) rather than msg_Error, inform a developer (unless you know how to fix it).  

=== Subversion ===
* subversion command for checking out just the QT4 code: 
<code>
svn checkout svn://svn.videolan.org/vlc/trunk/modules/gui/qt4 QT4Strings
</code>

=== Nightlies ===
* You can also use a nightly build to spot errors

=== What to do ===

* [[User:J-b|jb]] says dialogs are free to work on at this point.  --[[User:Tonsofpcs|tonsofpcs]] 01:17, 27 June 2007 (CEST)

* Menus and systray Menu too. [[User:J-b|jb]] 08:11, 27 June 2007 (CEST)

* Menus, then main interface, then tooltips, then anything remaining.  --[[User:Tonsofpcs|tonsofpcs]] 02:34, 25 October 2007 (CEST) (via j-b on IRC)

== Progress ==
* When you begin working on a file, if necessary add it to the table, then assign your name to it.  Once you finish it, mark it appropriately.
