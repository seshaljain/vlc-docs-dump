== Videos are too dark<br>  ==

Often this is caused by video hardware overlay problems:<br> 

If it is only one video then use the "Settings" menu, option "Extended GUI" and try to increase the Gamma value in the "Video" tab. 

<br>Check your video card settings and turn off hardware video overlay. 

If the videos now play with proper lighting, then deinstalling and reinstalling the video drivers might help.<br>
