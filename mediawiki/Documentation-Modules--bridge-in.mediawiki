== Options ==
{{Option
|name=sout-bridge-in-delay
|value=integer
|default=0
|description=Pictures coming from the picture video outputs will be delayed according to this value (in milliseconds, should be &ge; 100 ms). For high values, you will need to raise caching values.
}}
{{Option
|name=sout-bridge-in-id-offset
|value=integer
|default=8192
|description=Offset to add to the stream IDs specified in bridge-out to obtain the stream IDs bridge-in will register.
}}
{{Option
|name=sout-bridge-in-name
|value=string
|default="default"
|description=Name of this bridge-in instance. If you do not need more than one bridge-in at a time, you can discard this option.
}}
{{Option
|name=sout-bridge-in-placeholder
|value=boolean
|default=disabled
|description=If set to true, the bridge will discard all input elementary streams except if it doesn't receive data from another bridge-in. This can be used to configure a placeholder stream when the real source breaks. Source and placeholder streams should have the same format.
}}
{{Option
|name=sout-bridge-in-placeholder-delay
|value=integer
|default=200
|description=Delay (in ms) before the placeholder kicks in.
}}
{{Option
|name=sout-bridge-in-placeholder-switch-on-iframe
|value=boolean
|default=enabled
|description=If enabled, switching between the placeholder and the normal stream will only occur on [[I-frame]]s. This will remove artifacts on stream switching at the expense of a slightly longer delay, depending on the frequency of I-frames in the streams.
