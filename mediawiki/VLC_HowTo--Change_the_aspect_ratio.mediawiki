<noinclude>{{Howto|Change the aspect ratio of videos}}</noinclude>

<onlyinclude>Graphical and command-line approaches are both possible. For all methods both decimals and width:height values may be given, so a fullscreen [[aspect ratio]] would be accepted as both 4:3 and 1.33 (lists of popular aspect ratios: [https://widescreen.org/aspect_ratios.shtml Widescreen.org] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image) Wikipedia]).

For the [[Qt Interface]]: In the menu bar select '''Tools''' → '''Preferences''' → '''Video''' → '''Force Aspect Ratio'''.

As described in [[Documentation:Command line#Video_options]] <code>--aspect-ratio</code> can be given on the command-line. Unlike the graphical approach, this will not modify settings permanently.</onlyinclude><noinclude>
