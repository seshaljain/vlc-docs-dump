Being a [[Container]] format, ogg can embed third-party codecs (such as [[DivX]], [[XviD]], [[MP3]] and others) but usually Ogg is used with [[Vorbis]], [[Theora]], [[FLAC]] and [[Dirac]].<BR>

== Accepted codecs ==
Below are the compatible codecs for OGG.

=== Accepted audio codecs ===
* [[vorb]]: Vorbis handles general audio data at mid- to high-level bitrates (~16-256 kbit/s/channel)
* [[flac]]: Free lossless audio codec. Has same sound quality as [[wave]], but only cca half the size. 
* [[spx]]: Speex handles voice data at low bitrates (~8-32 kbit/s/channel)

=== Accepted video codecs ===
* [[theo]]: Theora based upon On2's [[VP3]], it is targeted at competing with MPEG-4 video (i.e. [[DivX]] and [[XviD]]), [[RealVideo]], or [[WMV|Windows Media Video]].
* [[drac]]
* [[tark]] (decoding only): Tarkin, an experimental codec utilizing 3D wavelet transforms. It has been put on hold, with Theora becoming the main focus for video encoding. 

* [[mpgv]]: MPEG
* [[mp4v]]: MPEG-4
* [[div3]]: DIVX 3
* [[mjpg]]: MPJPEG video
* [[wmv1]], [[wmv2]], [[wmv3]]: Windows media
* [[snow]]
* [[ms]] (decoding only): 
* [[xvid]] (decoding only):

=== Meta codecs ===
* [[cmml]] (decoding only): Text information
