Greetings! If you are looking for help, please check out [[Common Problems]] or the [https://forum.videolan.org/ forum], not here, thanks!

== About me ==
I am a largely anonymous participant in this interesting and fun project that is VideoLAN.<br />
I will describe myself with a quote from the film ''[[Wikipedia:V for Vendetta|V for Vendetta]]:''

<blockquote>"Who? Who is but the form following the function of what &hellip;"</blockquote>

&hellip; and what I am is an editor, computer hobbyist, and VLC enthusiast.

I possess a fairly intimate knowledge of computers and can code in such languages as (X)HTML, C++, and JavaScript.<br />
I love and support VLC both philosophically (its open-source and free design) and personally (because I think it's wicked cool). I do some work around here copy-editing, expanding, and maintaining the documentation regarding VLC.<br />
If you think I can help out, or want to place questions, concerns, or anything else, drop me a line on [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|my talk page]]. Cheers!
