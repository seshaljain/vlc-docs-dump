== VLC cannot play some WMV or WMA files.<br>  ==

Starting with VLC media player 0.8.6, the playback of WMV3-encoded videos is available on all platforms. 

Please download and install the latest version of VLC Media Player to solve playback issues. 

<br> 

Please note that encrypted / DRM-protected video-clips still cannot be played. 

That is due to the nature of DRM and is not about to change.
