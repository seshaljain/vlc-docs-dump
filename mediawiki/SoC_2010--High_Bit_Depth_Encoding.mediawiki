== Abstract ==

The primary goal for this project is to prepare the code base of x264 for encoding H.264 video with user defined sample depths. This will involve templating the encoder and migrating existing C code for use with higher sample depths.

A lot of optimizations are done with assembly, and will thus also need to be migrated. The secondary goal for this project is therefore to identify new assembly code to be written.

== Milestones ==

{| class="wikitable"
