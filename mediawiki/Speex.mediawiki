'''Speex''' is a deprecated speech-oriented audio codec designed for use over packet networks (e.g. [[HTTP]], local network use) and [[VoIP]] applications. As of 2013, Speex.org recommends parties consider [[Opus]] instead, calling the Opus codec superior.

It supports [[compression]] in a [[lossy]] way. It uses [[CELP]] (Code Excited Linear Prediction) to compress, meaning it takes advantage of the frequency patterns of human speech to efficiently compress data; this also means harmonics that do not follow this pattern will perform poorly (e.g. electronic music). {{VLC}} has supported decoding and encoding Speex since version 0.7.0.
