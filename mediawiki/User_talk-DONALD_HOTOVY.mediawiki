I recently installed windows 7 Ultimate N(x86) and media pack when i try and tried to installed VlC 1.11.1 i receive the following error " a referral was returned from the server" after chasing the problem through tech net and adding the '''<add key="ADReferralChasingOption" value="All" />''' to web.config i also installed net meeting updated client neither change has made a difference !

Help I am stumped and showtime sucks
