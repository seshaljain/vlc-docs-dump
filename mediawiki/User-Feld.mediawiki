Hi, my name is Feld.  

== Problem: Cannot keep settings for capture device ==

I am using version 0.8.5 of VLC with the wxWindows interface.  The computer/OS is an Athlon 64 running Windows XP Home.  The capture device is a CompUSA "High Speed USB Video Grabber" which according to the drivers and to VLC is a "USB 2820 device".

My problem is that the capture device appears to output in a strange aspect ratio.  (The software that came with the device, ULead Video Studio 7 SE Basic, appears to be capturing from the device in a 950x480 aspect.)  

I have found how to get normal-aspect video to play on the screen: 
#''File''->''Open Capture Device''
#:I get the ''Open'' dialog, on the ''DirectShow'' tab.
#Press the ''Refresh list'' button across from ''Video device name''
#:In a few moments, "USB 2820 Device" appears.
#Select ''USB 2820 Device''
#Press ''Advanced options'' button
#:Get ''Advanced options (DirectShow input)'' dialog
#Check ''Device properties'' checkbox
#Click ''OK'' on ''Advanced options (DirectShow input)'' dialog
#Click ''OK'' on ''Open'' dialog
#:Get ''Properties'' dialog with tabs ''Video Decoder'', ''Video Proc Amp'', and ''Video Image'' tabs.  On ''Video Decoder'' tab:
#:*''Video Standard'' is set to "NTSC_M"
#:* ''Signal Detected'' is 1
#:* ''Lines detected'' is 525
#:* ''VCR Input'' is unchecked.
#Click ''OK'' on ''Properties'' dialog with ''Video Decoder'', ''Video Proc Amp'', and ''Video Image'' tabs.
#:Get ''Properties'' dialog with single ''Stream Format'' tab.  Panes are ''Video Format'' and ''Compression''; on ''Video Format'' pane:
#:* ''Video Standard'' is set to "NTSC_M" (unchangable here)
#:* ''Frame Rate'' is "30.000"
#:* ''Flip Horizontal'' is greyed out
#:* ''Color Space / Compression'' is set to ''I420''
#:* ''Output Size'' says the default is "640x480" but is always "352x240" when this dialog first appears.
#Click ''Apply'' and ''OK''
#:Get ''Properties'' dialog with single ''Crossbar'' tab.  Panes are ''Input'' and ''Output''.
#Click ''OK''.
#:Video from capture device now appears on screen in a normal aspect ratio.

This works to get video onto the screen, but I would like to use VLC to save the video I'm capturing to file.  I can't seem to do this, because if I try to set up a transcoding chain with the input from the capture device, I have no way of changing the Output Size to the 640x480 it should be.
