=== Advance Synchronisation ===

When subtitles are '''late''' compared to the audio, and only in this case, you can use the advance synchronisation functionality of VLC :

*Step 1 : Detect (“hear and see”) that subtitles are out of sync
*Step 2 : Press '''Shift H''' when you hear a sentence that you will be able to easily recognize
*Step 3 : Press '''Shift J''' when you read the same sentence in the subtitle
*Step 4 : Press '''Shift K''' to correct the sync
