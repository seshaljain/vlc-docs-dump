<br>There is probably a problem with the output layer. There are several ways of troubleshooting it. First, try with another output plugin, for instance: 

<br>% vlc -V sdl<br>% vlc -V x11 

<br>Second, change your screen depth and/or definition. It quite often helps. 

Lastly, if running Unix, have a look at your X.Org video driver.<br>
