{{Wikipedia|Secure Real-time Transport Protocol}}
'''SRTP''' or '''Secure RTP''' uses encryption with the aim of authenticating and securing [[RTP]]. It has a companion [[protocol]], SRTCP, or secure [[RTCP]].

Unlike RTP it is not an {{IETF}} Internet Standard, meaning support is experimental for most implementations.
