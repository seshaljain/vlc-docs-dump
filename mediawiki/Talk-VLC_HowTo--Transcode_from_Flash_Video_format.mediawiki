Do you also have problems when using a nightly build ? [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 09:40, 18 October 2006 (CEST)

: Yes, perhaps I should explain this page. I made it as I was sent a link [http://www.scaryideas.com/Videos/TruthInAdvertising/ here] to [http://youtube.com/get_video?video_id=-uLxKzqpSSA&t=OEgsToPDskJFSgqk8nQUBfjkFd97fFdR this .flv file] (youtube). The seekbar stays at the end, and it stops playing half way through.
: I think it could be to do with seeking. Seeking at all makes it go wrong, and there are "access_file access error: seeking too far" errors when it fails. The duration is tagged as "ffmpeg demuxer debug: - duration = -1"
: Also, the following works: " cat Desktop/-uLxKzqpSSA.flv | vlc - "
: I'm using the Debian Unstable version (svn-20061012). FLV support works almost all the time for me, but sometimes on youtube you get the odd one which doesn't quite work.  --[[User:H2g2bob|h2g2bob]] 03:26, 19 October 2006 (CEST)
