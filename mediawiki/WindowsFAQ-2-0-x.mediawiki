==Video output related questions and problems==
===Why does VLC only give black, white or garbled (or other visual errors) video output?===
Usually the problem lies in display adapter drivers. If you are too scared to update your display adapter drivers, you can change VLC settings to make video work. If you are using Windows XP or older the easiest fix is usually to disable '''Accelerated video output/Overlay video output''' which can be found first opening '''Tools -> Preferences''' and then choosing '''Video'''. After you have unticked the Accelerated video output, press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.
[http://raiska.comeze.com/tutorials/vlc092/11a.png Image about Overlay video output setting]

If disabling Overlay video output doesn't help, then the next step is to change video output module (aka '''VOUT'''). Open '''Tools -> Preferences''' (set Show Settings to All) and then choosing '''Video -> Output module'''. There are multiple output modules you can use. For Windows XP and younger you can try '''DirectX 3D''', '''DirectX''', '''OpenGL''' and '''Windows GDI''' video output modules. With Windows Vista and with Windows 7, both DirectX and Windows GDI output modules will disable Aero, so if you want to use Aero, please use DirectX 3D (should be default). Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

===Video shows green, blue or red lines===
See above.

===Video Colors are washed out (NVIDIA issue)===
Please see [[VSG:Video:Color_washed_out]]

===How can I adjust brightness or contrast?===
You can adjust brightness, contrast and other settings via '''Extended settings'''. Open '''Tools -> Effects and Filters''' to adjust these settings ('''Video Effects -> Essential''' and tick '''Image adjust'''). Changes should show up realtime.

====How can I keep the brightness and contrast adjustments in memory forever?====
Open '''Tools -> Preferences''' (set Show Settings to All) and then choosing '''Video -> Filters -> Image Adjust''' and set values you want to use (trial and error).

====Can I set file specific brightness or contrast?====
Yes, but it isn't that easy. You have to create VLC shortcut or bat file with proper settings. More info can be found from [http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=46202#p152964 this] thread

===How do I set the default deinterlace method?===
'''Tools -> Preferences''' (Show settings: All) '''Video -> Filters''' and tick '''Deinterlacing''' video filter from under '''Video output filter module''' (NOT FROM UNDER Video filter module!). Then '''Video -> Filters -> Deinterlace''' and choose the default mode. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

==Audio output related questions and problems==
===Crackles, pops, hizzes and other audio anomalies===
If you hear some unwanted audio problems you can try another audio output module to see if that solves the issue (Save and restart VLC after changes). Open '''Tools -> Preferences''' (set Show Settings to All) and then choosing '''Audio -> Output module'''. There are multiple output modules you can use for audio. '''DirectX''' and '''Win32 waveOut''' should work in most cases. Unfortunately there isn't an ASIO support in VLC. 
[http://raiska.comeze.com/tutorials/vlc092/10b.png Image about audio output modules setting]

===Crackles, pops, hizzes and other audio anomalies with SPDIF passthrough===
SPDIF passthrough of Dolby Digital (AC3) and DTS audiotracks don't work with all soundcards. '''Win32 waveOut''' output module should work better with SPDIF.
===I don't hear dialog, conversations etc. while playing 5.1 audio===
Make sure you have select proper speaker setup from Windows audio settings or from soundcard control panel. If you have done so, make sure VLC also has right settings. '''Audio -> Audio Device''' to select proper speaker settings during playback.
===How do I adjust audio delay?===
During playback you can press '''k''' or '''j''' to adjust audio delay (adjust step is 50 ms).
===How can I play external audio track with video?===
'''Media -> Open (Advanced)...''' and select the video file and after that tick '''Show more options''' and then '''Play another media synchronously...''' and select the audio file you want to use. Then when playing the video go to '''Audio -> Audio Track -> Track 2''' to select the second (or whichever it is) audio track (this so called Slave-mode doesn't work correctly).
===How do I change my output device in case I have multiple audio devices connected to my PC?===
Open '''Tools -> Preferences''' (set Show Settings to All) and if you use DirectX, then '''Audio -> Output modules -> DirectX''' and '''Output device'''. If you use Waveout, then '''Audio -> Output modules -> WaveOut''' and '''Select Audio Device'''. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.
===How can I override speaker setup? (e.g. I want to always default to stereo)===
You can force speaker setup if you use DirectX audio output from '''Tools -> Preferences''' (set Show settings to All) '''Audio -> Output modules -> DirectX''' and '''Speaker configuration''' dropdown menu. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.
===Why does VLC volume change when I attach my mobile phone to computer during playback?===
This is a feature of Windows. You can adjust this via '''Control Panel'''. Open '''Sound''' and go to '''Communications''' tab.<br />

[http://raiska.comeze.com/tutorials/vlc092/25.png Image about fullscreen controller setting]

===Why doesn't the time slider show up?===
If you use WindowBlinds or similar custom skin engine, it usually breaks QT4 interface in VLC. So either disable that engine with VLC or change VLCs GUI to something else (like skins2).

===How can I disable showing of the filename when video starts?===
Go to '''Tools -> Preferences''' (set Show Settings to All) and '''Video''' and untick '''Show media title on video'''. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

==Codec compatibility related questions and problems==
===How can I identify what codecs the file uses===
With VLC, Open the file you want and open '''Tools -> Codec Information'''.
===VLC doesn't identify used codecs correctly or gives "undf" as codec or I want more information about specs===
There are multiple video and audio identification tools, but one very useful is tool called [http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/ Mediainfo].
===H.264/MPEG-4 AVC playback is too slow (or laggy)===
You can speed up the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC playback by disabling loop filter for H.264 decoding. To do this go to '''Tools -> Preferences''' and '''Input / Codecs ''' and in the drop-down box for '''Skip H.264 in-loop deblocking filter''' change it to '''All'''. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

Also if you have multicore CPU (or one with Intel Hyper-Threading), you can lower the FFMPEG thread count.  To do this go to '''Tools -> Preferences''' (Show settings: All), then '''Input / Codecs -> Video codecs -> FFmpeg''', then locate Threads, and set it to 4 (or to 2, or to 1). Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

===H.264/MPEG-4 AVC or VC-1 playback is full of image errors===
You can also try to enable/disable GPU decoding, and see if it helps. It can be found from '''Tools -> Preferences''' and '''Input & Codecs''' and tick/untick '''Use GPU accelerated decoding'''. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

===Problem with Real audio or Real video support===
Most Real audio or Real video should work with VLC 2.0.0, but if you have file that doesn't work then post thread to forums.
===Why can't VLC use CoreAVC, FFDshow, AC3filter, etc. codecs?===
VLC only uses built in codecs (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player]) so it doesn't support VfW or DirectShow APIs for codecs.
You are free to hack the source and use it, though, for example it is possible to make VLC into a directshow filter [http://www.sensoray.com/support/videoLan.htm].
====But you support [[DMO]] (Direct Media Object) module for WMV video and WMA audio====
WMV and WMA are exceptions to this external codec support.

==File and media format compatibility related questions and problems==
===Some DVD movies don't work at all or they crash/freeze to menu or playback===
If you open DVD with '''DVD''' selection, try with '''No DVD menus''' option (aka '''dvdsimple''').

Some new DVD movies use copy protection mechanisms that VLC doesn't support. It might help if you rip that movie to hard drive using tools like '''DVDFab Decrypter''' or '''AnyDVD''' and use VLC to playback these files from hard drive.

You may also be able to play these copy protected DVDs by opening the movie initialization file directly. Use the '''Open File''' function in VLC and navigate to the '''VIDEO_TS''' directory on the DVD, then open the '''VIDEO_TS.IFO''' file. Some of the newest copy protection schemes have been found to use tricks that confuse many of the current DVD software programs so they cannot locate this file properly to initiate playback on their own. This method has been found to work with some of the newest DVDs that won't open properly in VLC 1.1.11 using the standard approaches.

===DVD movies don't playback smooth (they stutter, lag, etc.)===
One thing that might help is increasing the VLC DVD cache. This can be done from '''Tools -> Preferences''' (set Show Settings to All) and '''Input / Codecs''' and increase '''Disc caching (ms)''' value to e.g. 5000 or 20000. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

If DVD files from hard drive work better, then check that your DVD drive has DMA enabled (if it is a IDE/ATAPI DVD drive).

===Can I play DVD files (VOB+IFO) from hard drive?===
Yes you can. Use '''Media -> Open Disc...''' and instead of DVD drive, point the location to correct folder by using either '''Browse...''' button or customize field . For example: '''dvd://"c:\movies\BLOOD DIAMOND\VIDEO_TS"'''
===How do I handle the broken AVI files?===
Some AVI files may give '''The AVI file is broken. Seeking not work correctly.Do you want to try to repair(this might take a long time)''' dialog. Those AVI files have some issues and you can try to fix those file temporarily with VLC or permanently with other tools. If you don't fix those files, seeking won't work correctly and those files may also crash players. 
====Can I always perform same repair action?====
Yes you can. This can be done from '''Tools -> Preferences''' (set Show Settings to All) and '''Input / Codecs -> Demuxers -> AVI''' and select the wanted action from '''Force index creation''' dropdown box. '''Ask''' is default (it will always ask what you want to do). '''Always fix''' tries to always fix AVI files and '''Never fix''' always starts the playback without fixing. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.
====Can I fix those broken AVI files permanently?====
Yes. You can try for example [http://www.divfix.org/ DivFix++] or [http://www.virtualdub.org/ Virtualdub] for fixing. Virtualdub [http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=45427&p=143688&hilit=virtualdub#p143688 help].

====Can I fix those broken or partially downloaded Matroska/MKV files too?====
Yes. You can try [http://meteorite.sourceforge.net Meteorite] for fixing.
===Some MP4 or 3GP files don't have audio at all===
If those files have AMR audio (usually ones from mobile phones) they might not work with current stable VLC versions.
===How do I enable Blu-ray disc playback (for commercially released Blu-rays)===
You have to download some additional files, see http://vlc-bluray.whoknowsmy.name/
==Subtitles related questions and problems==
===How do I adjust subtitle delay?===
During playback you can press '''h''' or '''g''' to adjust subtitle delay (adjust step is 50 ms).
===How can I select right subtitle track?===
If your video has multiple subtitle tracks, you can select the one you would like to see from '''Video -> Subtitles Track'''.
===Can I disable hardcoded or "burned" subtitles with VLC?===
No.
===Can I change font, font size, style or color?===
You can with text-based subtitle formats ([[Subtitles codecs]]). Go to '''Tools -> Preferences''' and '''Subtitles/OSD''' and adjust anything you want. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.
===How can I change subtitles text encoding?===
If you see wrong characters on screen or '''failed to convert subtitle encoding''' error message you should try to change '''Default encoding''' option which can be found from '''Tools -> Preferences''' and '''Subtitles/OSD'''. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

==General problems and issues==
===VLC crashes/freezes/BSODs my computer===
VLC doesn't do that. Normal apps shouldn't be able to cause issues like these to operating systems. Culprit is usually bad device driver (for example display adapter driver, soundcard driver, chipset driver, network adapter driver etc.) or broken hardware.
===How do I reset VLC settings?===
If you can start VLC, go to '''Tools -> Preferences''' and then press '''Reset Preferences''' and '''Save''' to reset and save VLC settings. Remember to restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.

If you can't start VLC, go to '''%appdata%''' folder and delete '''vlc''' folder from there (Start -> run and type '''%appdata%\vlc''' there and press OK if you can't locate %appdata%).

Also start menu -> VideoLan -> "Reset VLC media preferences ..."

===VLC crashes on startup===
This usually happens because VLC setting files have been corrupted. Resetting VLC settings (see above) should fix this.
===I messed up my file associations or I want to modify them===
Please read [[Windows#How_to_associate_media_files_to_VLC|this documentation]] or reinstall VLC.

===Can VLC burn CD, DVD, HD DVD or Blu-ray discs?===
No.
===Is VLC legal in all countries?===
Probably not. Specially DeCSS module might violate DMCA (and similar laws) and some codecs would require licenses for personal/commercial use. There haven't been any court cases related to VLC but specially companies should make sure they pay license fees to license holders if they use VLC commercially and use patented formats or codecs.

===Can I run multiple VLC instances?===
Yes you can. Read [[How_to_play_multiple_instances_of_VLC|this documentation]].

===VLC 2.0.0 doesn't work with Windows Me/98/98se/95/NT/2000===
This is by design. You need at least Windows XP with SP2 to run latest VLC. With Windows Me/98/98se/95/NT you can use VLC 0.8.6i out of box. With Windows 2000 the latest guaranteed working version is VLC 1.1.11. You can also check out [http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=64425 this forum post ] for tips running latest VLC under Windows 98 or Windows Me. Or [http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=98239#p328759 this forum post ] for tips running latest VLC under Windows 2000.

===How can I make VLC to preview my eMule downloads?===
Check out [http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=61826#p206451 this forum post ].

===How do I specify the folder where the recorded files (via red rec button) will be stored?===
'''Tools → Preferences''' and '''Input & Codecs''' and '''Record directory or filename'''. Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.
