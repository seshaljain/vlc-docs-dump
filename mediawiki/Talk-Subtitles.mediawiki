Users should be warned that the interface for using .srt files is deplorable. If you double click the media file or use Quick Open File you never see the opportunity to select a corresponding subtitles file. In the relatively unique file browser that appears if you select Open File there is a checkbox item for setting characteristics for subtitles, including the specification of the file containing the subtitles. That is fine but there needs to be a way of specifying a subtitle file for a media file after it has been opened or many people will doubt the feature even exists.
