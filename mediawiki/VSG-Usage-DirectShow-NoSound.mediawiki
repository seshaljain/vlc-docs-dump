== No Sound on DirectShow Capture  ==



As odd as it sounds, try setting the sound device to ''''none''''. 

Also see [http://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?t=2859 this] link. 

Also can try to set the audio transcoding to anything besides AAC (see [http://betterlogic.com/roger/2010/07/videolan-cannot-stream-directshow-audio-and-video-no-audio/ this]).
