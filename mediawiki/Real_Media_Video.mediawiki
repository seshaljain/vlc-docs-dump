'''RealMedia Video''' is the video [[codec]] used in [[RealMedia]] files, which are played on [[RealPlayer]]. The Real Media Codecs are proprietary, which makes their support in other applications pretty difficult.

== Compatibility ==
Some versions of RealMedia video format can be played with VLC, but in your RealMedia file, there's all sorts of networking stuff, and it is that which causes problems. See [[RealMedia]] for more details.

The [[helix]] player and [[RealPlayer]] is better at playing this kind of file.
