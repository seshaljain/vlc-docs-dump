VLC locks up when trying to open a folder (MOVIE) stored on my hard drive. This situation began
when VLC downloaded an update (2.1.5). I uninstalled VLC and then downloaded fresh from the videoLAN
website. Same problem. In the upper left corner "vlc media player" flashes on and off in a rapid stuttering manner several seconds until the program locks up.
