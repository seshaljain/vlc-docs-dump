== Is this useful? ==

We already have the exact same info in the NEWS file. This wiki page would be helpful if it gave more detail about the different features. If it's just copy & paste, I'm not sure that it's worth it. [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 10:45, 19 April 2007 (CEST)

: First, the main need was a link to the specific changes for 0.8.6b, which is not possible with the NEW txt file; moreover, this file starts with the changes for 0.9.0-svn so that one has to scroll far down to actually find the 0.8.6b changes. (to be compared to this [[Release changes#Changes between 0.8.6a and 0.8.6b|direct link]])
: However, if you propose a better idea, that would be great.
: Second, as you said, this page can be "wiki-enhanced" to add information to the changes - like: "* added support for [[blah blah]] codec", and so on...
