VLC has three terminal [[interface]] modules. These are ''rc'', ''telnet'' and ''ncurses''.

== <span id="rc"></span> rc interface ==
{{See also|Documentation:Modules/rc}}

The '''rc''' module is a interactive command line interface. It allows you to type commands to make VLC do things. To start it, run <code>vlc --intf rc</code>. This is the default interface if no [[GUI]] environment is available. To get started type "help" followed by enter. Starting with VLC 0.8.0 you can access this interface through a network with a telnet-client by using the <code>--rc-host localhost:port</code> option.

== <span id="ncurses"></span> ncurses interface ==
{{See also|Documentation:Modules/ncurses}}

The '''ncurses''' module is something like a text-mode GUI, built with the well-known ncurses library. Linux users should be familiar with this kind of interface. This interface is not built by default, you need to add <code>--enable-ncurses</code> to the configure call. To start VLC with this interface run <code>vlc --intf ncurses</code>.

== <span id="telnet"></span> telnet interface ==
{{See also|Documentation:Modules/telnet}}

The '''telnet''' interface will allow you to use the telnet command to connect to VLC remotely from the network. It is comparable to the rc interface, but less advanced. It can be launched by running VLC like: <code>vlc --intf telnet</code>. Starting with the VLC 0.7.x-series, you can control VLC's VLM-module with this interface to manage multiple simultaneous streams. Notice that you should use the rc-interface if you don't need this feature.

to launch VLC with telnet interface:
 {{%}} vlc -I telnet --telnet-password test


The telnet interface is essentially over a "raw [[TCP]] socket." To interact with the instance at the command line (assuming the telnet interface's address is <code>10.0.0.100:4212</code>):

 {{%}} nc 10.0.0.100 4212
