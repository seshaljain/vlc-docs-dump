__NOTOC__
== Crackles, pops, hizzes and other audio anomalies ==

If you hear some unwanted audio problems you can try another audio output module to see if that solves the issue (Save and restart VLC after changes).

Open '''Tools → Preferences''' (set Show Settings to All) and then choose '''Audio → Output module'''.

There are multiple output modules you can use for audio. '''DirectX '''and&nbsp;'''Win32 waveOut'''&nbsp;should work in most cases.

=== Drivers ===
Be sure that your audio drivers '''are up to date''' and '''compatible'''! Out of date and incompatible drivers may cause audio anomalies in VLC.

For example, installing the WDM_A406 driver for a Realtek AC97 chip will cause VLC to clip audio badly. VLC runs perfectly fine when the bad driver is removed and the correct one installed.

=== ASIO ===
ASIO support in VLC exists, but you will have to enable it by compiling manually.
