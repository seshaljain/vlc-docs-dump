'''FAAD2''' or '''Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder''' is a project for ''decoding'' [[AAC]] in [[MPEG-4]] and [[MPEG-2]].

'''FAAC''' or '''Freeware Advanced Audio Codec''' is a project for ''encoding'' AAC in MPEG-4 and MPEG-2.

Both projects are released under the GPLv2, making them [[open-source]].<span id="Note-backlink"></span><sup>[[#Note|&dagger;]]</sup> SourceForge hosts [[Git]] (source code) for both components, and there are respective GitHub mirrors. SourceForge also hosts binaries (executable code) for Windows (<code>*.exe</code>) and Linux (<code>*.tar.gz</code>).

{{VLC}} uses the FAAD2 [[library]], libfaad, in the {{VLCSourceFile|modules/codec/faad.c|l=faad.c}} module; but VLC no longer uses the FAAC library, libfaac.

== Note ==
<big><sup>[[#Note-backlink|&dagger;]]</sup></big> When audiocoding.com says it supports DRM, it does not mean ''[[Digital Restrictions Management]]'' but rather ''Digital Radio Mondiale''. Supporting Digital Restrictions Management might (arguably) cast doubt on whether the project is truly open-source.
