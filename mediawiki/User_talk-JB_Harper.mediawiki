Hello,

I am using VLC media player 0.9.9 to display live video from a USB cature device.  Works great once I configure VLC for the device, is there a way to save the configuration so that VLC defaults to the configuration on start-up?

Hi,

I saw you duplicated this request to a wiki page named "Sitesupport-url". Be aware I deleted this page for those reasons:
* un-apropriate place
** The wiki articles are not suitable for such request or it will become a mess. Of course, user talk pages can handle them if you want, even if you may not get many answers. The [http://forum.videolan.org videolan forum] is very more dedicated for them.

* un-apropriate name, no reference/link
** Article names have explicit names and are mostly linked to other articles to make the entire wiki a navigable documentation set.



To answer you question, I would suggest you to try [[command line]] VLC usage and to search for dvb and bda forum topics. Maybe your graphical open dialog can show you hints of what is the command-line equivalent for your configuration. Then, it will be simple to create a shortcut or a batch file which launch VLC with appropriate parameters so VLC will directly be able to play your capture device.
