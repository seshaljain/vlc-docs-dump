[[What is cool in 0.9|VLC media player 0.9]] introduces a new interface based on the Qt toolkit.

Some of you, using GNOME or Xfce, seem reticent to that change, but let us explain a few things:

== VLC media player interface is a PLUGIN ==
* You can use VLC in command line, with the http interface, or even the old wx interface, that you can compile.


== VLC media player '''DOES NOT DEPEND''' on kdelibs ==

VLC media player Qt module needs:
* libQtCore,
* libQtGui,
* libvlc

That's it.

== How to have a Native look of VLC using Qt inside GTK environnement ==

You can use trolltech's QGtkStyle project to get a native GTK look. See http://labs.trolltech.com/page/Projects/Styles/GtkStyle for more information.
