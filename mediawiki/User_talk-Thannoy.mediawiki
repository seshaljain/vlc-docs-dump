Isn't madness the origin of our lives?

* '''bash completion''' config for VLC command line :p
** something exists in extra/ for zsh completion.
** begin from a docbok to generate a man page t
* stable '''unit-tests for web plugins''' (Javascript?) usable in command-line ''(doesn't have the "how" yet in mind)''
* environment to help using '''automated git bissect''', "pluggable" to webplugins unit-test CLI ''(wahoo yeah, dreaming :) )''
* (low) '''split file sout''' parameter (roll files with an index and a max time/size for each chunk)
* on mozplug X11, conditional embedded controls (play, pause, ..): done, optionnal now.
