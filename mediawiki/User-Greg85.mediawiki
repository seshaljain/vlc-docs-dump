Hello! My name is '''Gr√©gory Meunier'''.

I'm a student in Polytech'Nantes and I'm working around VLC during a school project with Actech ([[User:Thannoy|Thannoy]] and [[User:Remiii|Remiii]]) in order to find a possibilty to optimize its functioning in streaming mode. I'm just a beginner but I hope I'm going to get more familiar with the code soon.
