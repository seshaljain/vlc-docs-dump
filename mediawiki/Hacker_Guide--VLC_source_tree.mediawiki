This page lists the directories in the [https://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=tree source tree of VLC] to give an overview of the code.  Because VLC has evolved with not so much accumulation in mind, when a new coder looks at the code, s/he is terrified by the abundance of directories. This page was prepared to remedy that situation.

The directories are listed in alphabetical order, with an overview of their contents on the right.
