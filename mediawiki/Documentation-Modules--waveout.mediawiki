== Introduction ==
This is an optionnal audio output for Windows. It can be used when the [[Documentation:Modules/directx_aout | DirectSound]] module doesn't work.

It uses the normal Multimedia Windows API that is present since Windows 95.

== Options==
=== Float32 output ===
This option allows you to enable or disable the high-quality float32 audio output mode (which is not well supported by some soundcards).


=== Audio Device Selection ===
This option allows you to select the audio output device listed.

It uses the string name of the audio device.
