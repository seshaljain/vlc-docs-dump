Seriously, who cares about SVCD menus? Even when SVCD was popular, there were like 10 SVCDs with a menu on the whole planet! I would much rather suggest support for AVCHD and especially AVCHD-menues (such as f.ex. Toast and Nero produce). Or, as a makeshift, at least fix the broken .m2ts support in VLC. Or the freeze upon playing certain MKVs for that matter...
