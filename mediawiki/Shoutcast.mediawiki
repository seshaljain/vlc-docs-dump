{{Wikipedia|Shoutcast}}

Shoutcast is [[proprietary]] software primarily used for listening to [[web radio]]. [[Icecast]] is the [[open source]] version and is currently used in {{VLC}}.

== Replacement ==
Shoutcast was removed completely in 1.1.0. A [https://www.videolan.org/press/2010-1.html VideoLAN Press Release - Shoutcast] noted ''We want to emphasise the fact that features like SHOUTcast or icecast browsing are now doable using our new extension framework and you will find user-contributed extensions on https://addons.videolan.org/''.

There are [https://addons.videolan.org/browse/cat/322/order/top add-ons for Internet radio available at addons.videolan.org] but standard installs of recent versions might already be enough. VLC before and after the replacement look much the same, and both seem to allow online listening:

{{Clear}}

The steps differ slightly: open the playlist and select "Icecast Radio Directory" instead of "Shoutcast Radio".
