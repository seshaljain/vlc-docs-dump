== Windows deutch page ==

You lately modified [[Windows]] wiki page page from English to Deuch. I will cancel your edit:
* Official pages are written in English
* Your edit delete this English contribution (overwriting with Deutch)
* Your edit mess up the page (because of blank lines or spaces removed at beginning of some lines mainly)

I will copy your contribution to [[User:Wert/draft-de-windows]] for it to not be lost. But you should consider to merge it with the already existing [[De/Windows]] page. Before, you will have to clean your draft.
