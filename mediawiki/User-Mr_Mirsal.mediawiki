I'm a software developer focused on Free Software technology, web scale applications and cool new stuff. I also do design, and I build horizontally scalable server infrastructures because it's fun. I'm a really committed FOSS advocate and GNU/Linux power-user (I'm one of those who think that Free software can change the world to something better, and I'll do my best to make that happen).

I am maintaining the D-Bus control module as an implementation of the MPRIS [http://www.mpris.org] of which I am a co-author and maintainer.

I worked on [[SoC_2008/UPnP|DLNA UPnP A/V integration]] which started as my [[SoC_2008_projects|Google Summer of Code]] project, mentored by [[User:funman|Rafaël Carré]]. I wrote a few bits of code in the VLC core and I am currently rewriting the UPnP services discovery module in C.
