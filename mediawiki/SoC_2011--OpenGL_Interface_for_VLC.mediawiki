==Abstract==

A nice looking, intuitive, effect-oriented OpenGL interface for the VLC Media Player. It should combine the utility of the current Qt interface with the graphics of media centers. OpenGL will be used for all rendering operations for the interface, bringing a wide range of possibilities to develop pretty graphics. All the user interface elements will be specialized according to the needs of the VLC interface.

== Planning and Design ==

The interface has 3 main parts - user input, GUI (widgets in OpenGL), functionality (interaction with VLC).

User -> user input -> GUI <-> VLC 

User <- GUI <-> VLC

For video, a vout display submodule is provided. It uses helpers from vout display opengl. But all the drawing must be done by the run thread, the one with the OpenGL context. It looks like it works okay, but there are some problems with it's responsiveness on display requests - needs to be improved.

===Classes===
Main:
* GLIntf (module code, create main things) (not a class, it's like C code)
* MainInterface (centralizes the others, issues drawing and updates)

User Input:
* UserInputMonitor (handles input from multiple possible sources)
* AbstractUserInput (base class for an input type)
* SDLUserInput (input from SDL events - touch / mouse, keys)
* LircInput (buttons from remote control) - planned

Widgets:
* Widget (base class for every widget)
* Layout (sets positions, sizes of multiple widgets)
* DynamicLayout (layout that can transition smoothly)
* Container (a widget that can contain other widgets and has a layout)
* ScrollableContainer (a container with scrolling possibilities)
* ScrollBar
* PlaylistBrowser (the playlist)
* PlaylistItem (an item from the playlist)
* SelectorPanel (choose Media Library, Internet, etc.)
* SelectorItem (item for selecting media sources ^)
* Button (base class for a button)
* Label (draws text)
* MenuPanel
* PlayPanel
* PlayButton, VolumeWidget, StopButton, PrevButton, NextButton
* SeekSlider
* VideoWidget ("holds" the video)
* FilterEdit - planned

Functionality:
* PlaylistManager (like MainInputManager from Qt interface)
* InputManager (like InputManager from Qt interface)
* Dialogs (to handle showing dialogs using a dialog provider)

Effects:
* AbstractEffect (a generic effect)
* LinTransitionEffect
* ExpTransitionEffect
* ColorTransitionEffect

Other:
* TextCache
* TexPicture
* EventQueue
