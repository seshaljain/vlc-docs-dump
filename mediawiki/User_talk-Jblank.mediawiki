VLC has lately taken to opening itself very slowly (like, 10 minutes) or not at all.  Running W7 32 bit, latest VLC version.  Can you help?

:Offhand personal suggestion: have you tried [[VSG:ResetPrefs|resetting preferences]] or re-installing VLC? If it didn't install correctly, that might fix it.
