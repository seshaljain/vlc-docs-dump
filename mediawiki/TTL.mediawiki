{{Wikipedia|Time to live}}

'''TTL''' or '''Time to live''' is a number used to prevent data from circulating indefinitely.

For each hop in a network the data passes through, the TTL value is decreased by one; when it reaches zero, the packet of data is discarded. In this way, endless loops are broken (such as ''host A'' sending data to ''host B'' sending data to ''host C'' sending data back to ''host A'').

The default TTL value between [[operating system]]s differs, but it may not be greater than 255.
