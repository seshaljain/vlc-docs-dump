{{howto|Make your Video Files playable on an Play-Yan Micro}}

A Play-Yan Micro is a Nintendo peripheral for Nintendo portable game devices. See [https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/play_yan_micro/index.html Nintendo's official page (Japanese)] for more info.

(The rest of the page follow the format/tone set by the Ipod howto article.)

To play on this device, the file you copy to it needs to be of the correct format. This format is summarised below:
{|
| Video Codec
| '''mp4v'''
|-
| Audio Codec
| '''mp4a''' ([[MP4 audio]]), '''aac''' ([[AAC]])
|-
| [[Container]]
| '''mp4''' ([[MPEG-4|MPEG4/MOV]])
|-
| Size
| 240x174
|}

To make the video the correct size, you can edit the [[preferences]], or run vlc from a [[command prompt]]. For Windows, make a batch file as shown:

<!-- The correct language is "winbatch" but the \ and : characters are misinterpreted. -->
<syntaxhighlight lang="dos">
set INPUT=V:\media\sample.avi
set OUTPUT=V:\transcode output\sample.mp4
set VLC=F:\app\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe
%VLC% "%INPUT%" :sout=#transcode{vcodec=mp4v,vb=1024,scale=1,acodec=mp4a,audio-sync}:std{access=file,mux=mp4,url="%OUTPUT%"} --sout-transcode-width=240 --sout-transcode-height=176 --aspect-ratio=16:9
</syntaxhighlight>

Fill in the input and output filenames. (FIXME: Aspect Ratio does not seem to be working){{Check}}

Note: Some videos can be transcoded, some can't. This info is still a work in progress.
