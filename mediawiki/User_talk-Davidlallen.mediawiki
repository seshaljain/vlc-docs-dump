Hello, I don't really think you should have removed your code from the wiki. It is welcomed! We may however have wanted two differents section/wiki page for 0.8.6 and 0.9.0. Thanks! --[[User:Pdherbemont|Pdherbemont]] 02:53, 20 August 2007 (CEST)

Um, please see the *parent* page on tutorials.  I have added a complete working example for 0.8.6c and returned 
your page to the way it was. --[[User:davidlallen|davidlallen]] 10:39, 20 August 2007 (PST)
