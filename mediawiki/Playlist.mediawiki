Playlists are files that contain information on which files to play. Usually they are plain text files with paths to the files to play. Here an example in the [[M3U]] format:

 rock.mp3
 classical.mp3
 OTHER\new.mp3
 \\COMPUTERNAME\Music\Band\Artistname - Track - Title of the Song.mp3
  <nowiki>http://www.webaddress. com/.../movie clip.mp4</nowiki>
  <nowiki>http://111.22.333.44:8024</nowiki>

This file would instruct the player to first play the file rock.mp3, then classical.mp3 and then the file new.mp3 which is in the directory OTHER before accessing a song on the local network. Then it plays a movie clip in [[MP4]] format from the web and lastly switches to a [[web radio]] station.
