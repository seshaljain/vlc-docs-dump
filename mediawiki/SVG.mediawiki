SVG is an acronym for scalable vector graphics. It's an [[XML]]-based container that allows for resizing certain types of images to any size without appearing pixellated. It falls under the class of ''vector image formats'', in contrast to ''raster image formats'' (e.g. [[JPG]], [[GIF]]). It supports [[lossless]] [[compression]].
