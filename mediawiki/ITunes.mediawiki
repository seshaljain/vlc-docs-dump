'''iTunes''' is a [[media player]] created by Apple for [[macOS]] and [[Windows]] (2000 and later). iTunes has the ability to connect with an [[iPod]].

iTunes also connects to [https://www.apple.com/retail Apple Store]. Like almost all music bought online, this music is protected by [[DRM]] (in this case [[FairPlay]]).

iTunes can also share music over a local network using the [[wikipedia:Bonjour (protocol)|Bonjour protocol]].

==Compatibility==
VLC supports service discovery with Bonjour through its [[Documentation:Modules/bonjour|bonjour]] module and supports DAAP (iTunes shares).
