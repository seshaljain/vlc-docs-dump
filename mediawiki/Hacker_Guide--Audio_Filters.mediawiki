===I/O Buffers===
Data comes in and out the plugin in an [https://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc/doc/doxygen/html/structaout__buffer__t.html aout_buffer_t], one sample at a time, and in each sample, one block by channel.

An audio filter module is constituted of a constructor, a destructor, and a <code>p_filter->pf_do_work</code> function. The constructor is passed a p_filter structure, and it returns 0 if it is able to do the whole transformation between <code>p_filter->input</code> and <code>p_filter->output</code>. If you can do only part of the transformation, say you can't do it (if the aout core doesn't find a fitting filter, it will split the transformation and ask you again).

===Note===

Audio filters can be of three types :

* Converters : change <code>i_format</code> (for instance from float32 to s16).
* Resamplers : change <code>i_rate</code> (for instance from 48 kHz to 44.1 kHz).
* Channel mixers : change <code>i_physical_channels</code>/<code>i_original_channels</code> (for instance from 5.1 to stereo). 

Audio filters can also combine any of these types. For instance you can have an audio filter which transforms [[A/52]] 5.1 to float32 stereo.

The constructor must also set <code>p_filter->b_in_place</code>. If it's <code>0</code>, the aout core will allocate a new buffer for the output. If it's <code>1</code>, when you write a byte in the output buffer, it destroys the same byte in the input buffer (they share the same memory area). Some filters can work in place because they just do a linear transformation (like <code>float32->s16</code>), but most filters will want <code>b_in_place = 0</code>. The filter can allocate private data in <code>p_filter->p_sys</code>. Do not forget to deallocate it in the destructor.

The <code>p_filter->pf_do_work</code> gets an input and an output buffer as arguments, and process them. At the end of the processing, do not forget to set <code>p_out_buf->i_nb_samples</code> and <code>p_out_buf->i_nb_bytes</code>, since they aren't inited by the aout core (their values can change between input and output and it's not quite predictable).


==Writing an audio mixer==

Writing an audio mixer is very similar to writing an audio filter. The only difference is that you have to deal with the input buffers yourself, and request for new buffers when you need to. Between two calls to <code>pf_do_work</code>, the position in the buffer is remembered in <code>p_input->p_first_byte_to_mix</code> (it isn't always the start of the buffer, since input and output buffers can be of different length). It is your job to set this pointer at the end of <code>pf_do_work</code>.

For more details, please have a look at the float32 mixer. It's much more understandable than lines of documentation.
