Hi,

i read your site with much hope to solve the dvd-region problem on my power book G4. as long as it has a Matshita DVD-R UJ-835E i tried the vlc-player as recommended at your side. but it did not work! i can start the dvd but can't go further to start the movie/can not use the interactive buttoms  as usual. when i try  i always get the following messages:
main picture to date 0x21a5a3c has invalid status 6
main picture display 0x21a5a3c has invalid status 6
picture 0x21a5a3c refcount is - 1

and after that, access file error:
 "access_file: read failed (permisson denied)"

crash log is empty

what to do?????????????

thanks to everybody
