-I'm adding this section as a place to store ideas that we might incorporate into the project, but which are still at the discussion stage.

* create status.json and playlist.json - update: in progress by CV
* update web interface pages to request and use json requests - update: probably not relevant with new interface by elminster
* expose dvd info (chapter title)
