{{Module|name=opensles|type=Audio output|description=OpenSLES audio output|os=Android|first_version=2.1}}

== Introduction ==
This is the latest audio output module found on the [[Android]] platform. It offers better lipsync than the AudioTrack modules.

Sometimes, however, on recent Android platforms an [https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/9325 Android bug] might prevent it from functioning well, so in that case trying out the AudioTrack (Java) audio output may be recommended.

== Options==
None.

== Source code ==
