==mpeg2dec and ffmpeg==
What is the relation with these two?  I believe ffmpeg has an mpeg2dec so why two mpeg 2 decoders? Thanks, [[User:Daniel.Cardenas|Daniel.Cardenas]] 01:51, 22 April 2007 (CEST)
: mpeg2dec is faster [[User:J-b|jb]] 02:36, 26 September 2007 (CEST)
:: and historicaly it was the first MPEG2 decoder to be used in VLC (you could argue that it doesn't really matter ... but still :)) [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 10:41, 26 September 2007 (CEST)

==FreeType==
VLC use FreeType 2.3.5, maybe it's possible to close [http://trac.videolan.org/vlc/ticket/839 ticket 839]?
