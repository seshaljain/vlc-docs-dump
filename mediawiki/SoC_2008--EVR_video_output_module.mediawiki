== SoC 2008/EVR video output module ==

As part of [[SoC_2008]] I (Kaarlo R채ih채 aka VLC_help) will try to implement EVR (Enhanced Video Renderer) video output module for {{VLC}}. EVR will hopefully be default video output module for Windows Vista but it might also work with Windows XP if the .NET Framework 3.0 is installed (it seems that no XP support is coming). EVR should guarantee tearing free output that also works with Aero.

If I have some extra time, I will try to add some features to Direct3D and OpenGL output module (shaders, rotating video etc.) and possible fix other Windows (Vista) related issues/bugs. I will continue on shader support after SoC.

=== Current status of project ===
Stage 3 under work. 

==== Git ====
http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc-vlchelp.git;a=summary
Doesn't compile or work, so the only useful stuff is in contribs folder.

==== Statistics ====
* Code: 0.379 kloc (for the output module only, doesn't include random patches, contribs or proto code)
* Comments: 0.179 kloc
* Total: 0.677 kloc

== Planned absence / Vacations / Holidays ==
Midsummer days (19.6.2008 - 22.6.2008)


== Timetable ==
=== Planned ===
Coding will start on 26th of May. There should be working module hopefully on first week of July (1st July - 6th July). Coding ends on 1st of September. Documentation and some support will continue after GSoC.

Stage 1: Use Visual Studio to create EVR sample code (one image, nothing fancy).

Stage 2: Get that same code compile under Cygwin environment (and make sure someone else can also compile it).

Stage 3a: Implement EVR module to VLC.
Stage 3b: Test EVR implementation (include various stress tests)
