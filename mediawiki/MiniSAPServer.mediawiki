{{Historical}}
MiniSAPServer was a lightweight and easy-to-use [[VideoLAN]] application that could produce [[SAP]] announcements.<br />
It is no longer necessary:
<blockquote>
<nowiki>…</nowiki> Remember [that] miniSAPserver should be used to announce the streams sent by [[VLS]];<sup>*</sup> the streams sent by [[VLC]]'s stream output can be announced by VLC itself ! <nowiki>…</nowiki><br />
―<cite>[https://www.videolan.org/news.html#news-2003-07-25 VideoLAN News - Release: miniSAPserver 0.2.2]</cite>
</blockquote>
<small>''<nowiki>*</nowiki> VLS [https://forum.videolan.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=11405 is deprecated], and the same functionality [https://www.videolan.org/vlc/streaming.html is built into VLC]''</small>

VLC can listen for SAP announcements with the {{docmod|sap}} module and announce them with the stream_out_rtp module. Since no wiki page exists yet, options can be found by typing into a [[command prompt]].<br />
Windows:
 {{Path to VLC|windows}} -p stream_out_rtp --advanced --help-verbose | more
macOS:
 {{Path to VLC|mac}} -p stream_out_rtp --advanced --help-verbose | less
Linux:
 {{Path to VLC|linux}} -p stream_out_rtp --advanced --help-verbose | less
