{{howto|change font, font size, style or colour|nosort=yes}}

The font settings can be adjusted for plain text [[subtitle]] formats. Font settings cannot be changed for rich text (e.g. [[ASS]]) or bitmap (e.g. [[DVD subtitles|DVD]]) subtitle formats.

Go to '''Tools → Preferences (set Show Settings to All) and Video → Subtitles/OSD → Text renderer''' and adjust anything you want. Font size in pixels overrides Relative font size selection.

Remember to press '''Save''' to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.


'''For advanced users on <big>Mac OSX</big> only:''' 

You may change the font directly with the [[preferences]] file, located at '''/Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/org.videolan.vlc/vlcrc''' 

*Quit VLC.

*Look for property named '''freetype-rel-fontsize''' (usually on line 1938). 

'''Remember: smaller value is bigger font.''' 

*Enter VLC to see changes take effect
