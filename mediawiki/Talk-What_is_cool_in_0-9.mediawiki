=== My love of the VLC UI, is gone? ===
The first impression was devastating for me going from 0.8.x to this 0.9.2,
* The dialogs,  in the Open-dialog I can't even type in samba-servers like \\172.16.0.10\ and browse them - vlc will try to open "\\172.16.0.10" as a FILE. 
* Where can I disable some of the things like - that interface down at the bottom on fullscreen? Perhaps we want fullscreen right away when we click fullscreen , I really would like an option
** I am putting the y-value to -1000, perhaps it helps

Maybe I am just ranting for no good reason here at the wiki, should I head out on a trac-system and shout loud there?  

The UI of VLC has always been such a fan for a computer nerd like me, speed, what I want, when I want it - these sort of things seems gone.
