==Link to Wikimedia, not Wikipedia==
Shouldn't the Editing Help at the foot of an 'Editing' Page, ie. the content of this page, link to a Wikimedia page, and not to a Wikipedia page? [[User:Stq|Stq]]

:Agreed; it's a much better editing help reference, too.  The wikipedia one has various style guides for encyclopedic referencing, etc.  I've updated the link. --[[User:Gth|Gth]] 18:16, 23 April 2012 (CEST)

==External Link icon==
Anyone else see the videolan witch-hat obscuring the last few letters of any external link in their browser? --[[User:Gth|Gth]] 18:16, 23 April 2012 (CEST)
