In the Open Source multimedia field there are various choices for multimedia streaming and playback. However analysing and checking validity of [[MPEG-TS]] streams is not really possible. DVBsnoop (http://dvbsnoop.sourceforge.net/) is the only application that is only one that comes near this goal, but it is a commandline utility. This doesn't make it easy to be used.

The goal of TS Info is to be an easy to use MPEG-TS (MPTS/SPTS) analyser with all the information, analysis and validation right under you finger tips. 

It should also be possible to insert the TS Analyser/TS Monitor in between the client and the server and monitor the stream for the boundaries configured. If the boundaries (or rules) are crossed, then a trigger will be sent to indicate a deviation from the required settings.

== Features ==

* Input from TS/RTP/UDP or TS/UDP
* Possible extension to use linux-dvb device (maybe use [[dvblast]] as input)
* PID list and bandwidths / %age - bargraph
* [[Bitrate]]s (also audio and video separate)
* Mux distance of audio and video packets
* SI table parsing (NIT, PMT, PAT, EIT, CAT, etc.) / descriptor parsing
* Detect scrambled content (check scrambling bits 11, 10, optional 01/00)
* [[I-frame]] gap
* Determine [[GOP]] length
* Detect Open/Closed GOP
* Teletext/closed captioning detection
* CRC errors
* I-frame decoding
* Discontinuity indication
* Subtitle decoding
* EPG grid
* PID selection and forwarding to VLC (via UDP stream?)
* Triggers on deviation from set boundaries (mux distance < 500ms, if not then sent trigger eg: sms/e-mail)
* Mention conformance to which standard and link to it if online source is available

== Architecture ==

proposal:
* TS Analyser GUI - user interface to browse the MPEG-TS stream content (information gathered is similar to DVBsnoop)
* TS Analyser     - real-time MPEG-TS analyser that informs the GUI/TS Monitor of features discovered and various measurements
* TS Monitor      - real-time MPEG-TS monitor that triggers on deviations of preferred features in the MPEG-TS stream

                                           |

MPEG-TS --------> RTP/UDP input ---> TS Analyser --> RTP/UDP output
(MPTS/SPTS)                                |
                                     TS Monitor --> send trigger if deviation detected
