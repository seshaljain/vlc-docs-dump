Buying music online which can play with [[VLC media player]] is tricky. Most online stores and record companies use [[DRM]], which disables the ability to play files in all [[media player]]s other than a few [[proprietary]] players which support the DRM they use. 

However, there are solutions. Defective by Design has [https://www.defectivebydesign.org/guide/audio a listing for DRM-free music sites]. Others are suggested below:

== Buy music from sources that don't use DRM ==
These stores usually encode their music in the VLC-compatible [[MP3]] format

== Buy from Open Record Labels ==
