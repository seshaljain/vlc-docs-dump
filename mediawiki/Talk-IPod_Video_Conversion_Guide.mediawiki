== Choice between H.264 and MPG4v unclear ==

The choice between H.264 and MPG4v should be made clearer.  The difference should be explained and used consistently.  Different sections switch between them, probably just historical, but it's confusing to the first time reader.  Most people just want to know "what's best", which isn't obvious, so we should say that, use one consistently and describe how to use the other one.

In Windows-Script I had to replace '''url'''=%outfile% with  '''dst'''=%outfile% and maybe vlc:quit with vlc://quit
I was using VLC 1.0.2

== GUI instructions don't work on Mac OS X (VLC 1.1.x) ==

"Stream output MRL Target:" is not available in the GUI on Mac OS X. Additionally, the command-line variant does not work because, at least for the binary at "VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/vlc", it attempts to stick the current working directory on the front of the :sout parameter, then falls over when that's not a real filename.
