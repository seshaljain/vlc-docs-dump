== DVD Movies lag ==
One thing that might help is increasing the VLC DVD cache. 

This can be done from '''Tools -&gt; Preferences''' (set '''Show Settings''' to '''All''') and'''Input / Codecs -&gt; Access Modules -&gt; DVD''' with menus (or DVD without menus if you use '''dvdsimple method''' for playback) and increase '''Caching value in MS''' value to for example to '''5000''' or to '''20000'''.

Remember to press '''Save''' to save '''VLC settings''' and restart '''VLC''' after that to make sure changes are enabled.

If '''DVD files''' from hard drive work better, then check that your '''DVD drive''' has '''DMA enabled''' (if it is a '''IDE/ATAPI DVD drive''').
