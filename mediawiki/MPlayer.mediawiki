MPlayer (from ''The Movie Player'') is a cross-platform [[media player]] released under GPLv2. The recommended way to install is to compile source code from <abbr title="Apache Subversion">SVN</abbr>, though builds (binaries) are available from third parties. Numerous [https://mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html#skins skins] are available&mdash;by default there is no skin, meaning no graphical user interface.

Work on the project began in 2000 and is still actively developed as of 2019, with extensive documentation and support lists.
