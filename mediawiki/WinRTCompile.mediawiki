This page will help you compile '''VLC for WinRT'''

==Development Environment==

To develop VLC for WinRT, you would need to have:
* Windows 8.1
* Visual Studio 2013 with Update 2 (or Update 3)
* Windows 8.1 SDK (Recommended)
* Latest version of [[Git]]
* Lots of patience :D

==Get the source==
 
You can clone the VLC for WinRT git repository

 git clone https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-winrt.git


==Get libVLC source==

====Packaged 7zip file====
You can download vlc.7z from [http://people.videolan.org/~hugo/vlc-Win32.7z here]. Extract the contents of vlc.7z and copy the contents to vlc folder of winrt source code

====Cross Compiling====
If you feel adventurous, you can try cross-compiling libVLC for WinRT. Refer to the [https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-winrt README] file in the source folder for more information

==Build and Deploy==
* Open the VLC_WinRT solution in app/VLC_WINRT.sln
* Open Package.appxmanifest, and generate a test certificate. More information can be found in the [https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-winrt/blob/master/README README] file in the source folder
* Click on Build Solution and then Deploy

==Additional Notes==
* If building fails with lots of errors referring to Windows SDK headers, installing Windows 8.1 SDK usually helps
* It helps to right click the specific project (eg: Windows 8.1 project ) and then click deploy rather than trying to deploy the whole solution
