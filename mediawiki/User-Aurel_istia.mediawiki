== '''General Presentation''' ==
Hello everybody.

My name is '''Aur√©lien DROCHON'''. 
I'm a student of ISTIA at University of Angers in France ([http://www.istia.univ-angers.fr ISTIA]).

For my study, I have a project to do and this project,called Recording, is in collaboration with the society Actech (Cybervia) including with the members of this site like [http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Thannoy Thannoy], [http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Remiii Remiii] and an other student of my school [http://wiki.videolan.org/User:Mathieu_istia Mathieu_istia].

I begin in development on VLC, so I risk to have some questions and I hope you help me. Thank you.

See you.
