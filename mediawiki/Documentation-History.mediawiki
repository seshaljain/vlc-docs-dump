== Overview of the VideoLAN project  ==
VideoLAN was a complete software solution for video streaming and playback, developed by students of the [http://www.ecp.fr Ecole Centrale Paris] and developers from all over the world, under the [https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html GNU General Public License] (GPL). 

Originally VideoLAN was designed to stream MPEG videos on high-bandwidth networks, but VideoLAN's main software, VLC media player, has evolved to become a full-featured, cross-platform media player. 

Now the Non-Profit Organisation developing and offering the VLC media player is called: VideoLAN Organisation 

More details about the project can be found on the [https://www.videolan.org/ VideoLAN Web site].
