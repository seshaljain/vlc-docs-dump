==Integration with Eclipse==

Like any Maven project, there are two ways to integrate the VLMa project with Eclipse:
* using the [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-eclipse-plugin/ Maven eclipse plugin] which is a maven plugin,
* using [http://m2eclipse.codehaus.org/ M2Eclipse] which is an Eclipse plugin.

If you plan to send patches, please ensure to set a 4-spaces indentation (no tabs!).
