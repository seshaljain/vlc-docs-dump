= Requirements =

== Goal ==

Central system for storing statistics and timings

== Stored data == 

What we might want to collect:

* per-stream/global decoded, dropped frames
* per-stream/global packets read/errors
* per-stream/global packets/bytes sent/errors (if sout)
* stats about httpd/vod, per request

Each thing could be stored as average, max, counter, ...

== Data access ==

* Access stats from the GUI (simple)
* Dump HTTP server access data
* Dump some raw access data to output

= Design =

== Data storage ==

=== Stats object ===

Stored as a singleton in p_libvlc

=== Counters ===

<pre>
counter_sample_t
{
   value
   date
}

counter_elem_t
{
   name
   type
   pp_samples / i_samples
}
</pre>

* Name contains the originating object id, like "267.frames_displayed" .How to separate by http request ? "httpd_object_id.request_id.XXX" ?
* Type is one of MAX, LAST, COUNTER, DERIVATIVE, ...

=== Timing ===

<pre>
timing_elem_t
{
   name

   last_time,

   total_time,
   total_samples,

   running,
   start_time   
}
</pre>

== Reporting ==

* In GUI:
** Integrated in streams and media information for relevant items (make it available for VLM streams too)
** Where to put global data ?

* Data log:
** Make global options to enable and driver logger module
** Add some logging facility to httpd
** RRD output (muwahahahaha)
