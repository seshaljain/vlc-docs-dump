Shouldn't we have generic templates for console examples:
like:
* "regular user on anything but windows template":
 % '''{ { { The command } } }'''
* "root user on anything but windows template":
 # '''{ { { The command } } }'''
* "command on windows template":
 > '''{ { { The command } } }'''
(and maybe have aliases for "vlc command" ... which would prepend the vlc.exe or ./vlc or vlc or whatever automatically)
