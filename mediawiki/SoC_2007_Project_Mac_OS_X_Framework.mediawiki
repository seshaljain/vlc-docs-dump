'''If you wish to use the framework refer to the [[Mac OS X Framework]] wiki page'''

=== Introduction ===

I ([[User:Pdherbemont|Pierre d'Herbemont]]) will use this wiki page to detail the work I'll do for the GSoC 2007. My mentor for this project is [[User:Fkuehne|Felix Kühne]].

=== Project Objectives ===

More information in [http://pdherbemont.free.fr/gsoc/vlc_framework.html my original Proposal].

=== Status Summary ===

The simple test app that links to VLC.framework is able to play a given video just fine.

I have been re-working libvlc, so that the OS X framework can be a nice umbrella over it. A vlc application could be rewritten without the need of any other VLC interface than LibVLC.

I have implemented a master-detail-view interface a-la iTunes using Cocoa Bindings, and the framework. It may be a good candidate to replace current VLC.app but it still need a lot of work. Main advantages are code base is very light. It is easily modifiable. It makes uses of Bindings (with its pros and cons).

So far I didn't complete some of my objectives for the Google Summer of Code:
* Some functionality of the framework such as media transcoding, (config) preferences tuning, and vout filter are not implemented.
* The web plugin does not take

See [[Git]] (thanks to [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]]).
More could be done to set up something better but that's enough for me for now ;)

| '''Implement the stub framework and the sample code that links to it.'''
See the commit on [http://git.videolan.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=vlc-soc.git;a=commit;h=164ffd0787906e6b6ef1be731a450d0296fde9e9 commit 1], [http://git.videolan.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=vlc-soc.git;a=commit;h=72e8aa87d1f2b5249e00d596ae015b049da6108d commit 2].

| '''First draft of the headers, plus partial implementation.''' Events, playlist, vout basic usage demo in the sample code.
* We do have some draft which cover vout/playlist and shows how events will be relayed.
* The sample code is less advanced than expected but that's fine, given the wanted simplicity.
* We do have, as a side effected, implemented VLCPlaylistDataSource which is an NSOutlineView data source, and is an efficient way to display the playlist from guest app.

=== Todo reminder ===
* Rename VLCMovieView to VLCMediaView
* Use a 1 sec time frame for the DidChangePosition
* Make mediacontrol uses libvlc

=== Code repository ===
All the code I did for the GSoC is publicly stored on VideoLan's svn trunk (libvlc related changes) and VideoLan's [http://git.videolan.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=vlc-soc.git;a=shortlog;h=pdherbemont_branch Git Repository for GSoC] on the '''pdherbemont_branch''' branch. To check it out:
 $ git clone git://git.videolan.org/vlc-soc.git
 $ cd vlc-soc
Now get my branch in a new local osx_framework branch:
 $ git checkout -b osx_framework remotes/origin/pdherbemont_branch
And to keep sync-ed, tell git to use remote pdherbemont_branch for osx_framework.
 $ git config branch.osx_framework.merge refs/heads/pdherbemont_branch
And tell git the remote repository is named origin.
 $ git config branch.osx_framework.remote origin
Now a simple:
 $ git pull
Should be enough to get synced.

=== Building the framework and the test app ===
* Build VLC as usual. see [[OSXCompile| How to build VLC on Mac OS X]].
* Build the framework
 $ cd extra/MacOSX/Framework
 $ make
* Now open extra/MacOSX/Framework/Examples/test/test.xcodeproject with Xcode
* hit command-R

Voilà!
