'''XML''' is an acronym for '''extensible markup language'''. It is a compromise between machine language and regular text. It resembles HTML (and can be mixed with HTML in some cases to make XHTML).
It looks like this:
<syntaxhighlight lang="xml">
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <location>
  <country>France
   <region>Île-de-France
    <department>Hauts-de-Seine
     <arrondissement>Antony
      <canton>Châtenay-Malabry
       <university>École Centrale Paris</university>
      </canton>
     </arrondissement>
    </department>
   </region>
  </country>
 </location>
</syntaxhighlight>
The tags are readable by humans with some effort, and machines can parse XML as a data tree. [[Subtitle]] formats are sometimes written in XML.
