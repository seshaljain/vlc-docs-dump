'''Lossless''' is a way of [[compress]]ing data which is fully reversible, i.e., does not "throw away" data. A losslessly compressed file can be used to create an exact copy of the source file.

'''Lossy''' is the opposite of lossless. A certain amount of data is discarded; how much is usually dependent upon a quality or [[bit rate]] setting of the codec.  This makes the file (or stream) much smaller that lossless compression, but reduces the quality.  It is impossible to [[transcode]] from one lossy format to another without further degrading quality.
