Hi,

I am working on GUI of VLC Player for WPF in C#. I want to add an option for end user to rotate/transform video to specific angle on-the-fly.

I was able to rotate at initialization time with following Video filter.
--video-filter=rotate {angle=180}

Can you please let me know your LibVLC API used to rotate/transform video on-the-fly?

Thanks,

Waheed
