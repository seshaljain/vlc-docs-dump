It is not said in which directory are images saved if image output enabled.
: Default is to save them in the current directory (unless you change the --image-out-prefix option's value to something like "/a/b/img" which will make it save in directory /a/b/). Feel free to update the description in the article. [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 10:37, 7 September 2007 (CEST)

Regarding cloning the output. Is ''-clone-vout-filter=...'' correct, or should it be ''-clone-vout=...''? The former gives an error for me (Windows XP).
I needed to get the video to output on both monitors on a dual display system. To get it to work (without getting blank windows rather than video) I had to set the DirectX module to output to DISPLAY2 and then set  ''--clone-vout=vout_directx,opengl''.
