{{howto|modify your video output}}

If you have no video for some type of files or all of them, you can try to change the video ouput.

Go to '''Tools''' &gt; '''Preferences''' &gt; '''Video''' and in the '''Display''' section, try another ''Ouput''.

Sometimes, you have to deactivate the '''Accelerated video output (Overlay)''' too.
