* You uploaded [[:Image:Interface.png|an image]] of the windows 0.9.x interface. Could you link it to related articles? --[[User:Thannoy|Thannoy]] 10:10, 15 December 2008 (CET)
* Ok, so working on [[Documentation:VLC for dummies]] page, a good idea. But why didn't you use [[:Image:Vlc-en.png]]? Nevermind, thanks :) --[[User:Thannoy|Thannoy]] 13:24, 15 December 2008 (CET)
