== DVD Movies don't work or crash ==
If you open '''DVD''' with DVD selection, try with '''No DVD menus''' option (aka '''dvdsimple'''). 

Some new DVD movies use copy protection mechanisms that VLC doesn't support.It might help if you rip that movie to hard drive using tools like '''DVDFab Decrypter''' or '''AnyDVD''' and use VLC to playback these files from hard drive. 

You may also be able to play these copy protected DVDs by opening the movie initialization file directly. Use the '''Open File''' function in VLC and navigate to the '''VIDEO_TS''' directory on the DVD, then open the '''VIDEO_TS.IFO''' file. Some of the newest copy protection schemes have been found to use tricks that confuse many of the current DVD software programs so they cannot locate this file properly to initiate playback on their own. This method has been found to work with some of the newest DVDs that won't open properly in VLC 1.1.11 using the standard approaches.
