{{Module|name=esd|type=Audio output|description=[[wikipedia:EsounD|EsounD]] audio output|os=Linux|first_version=0.0.95|last_version=0.9.10}}

Enlightened Sound Daemon (also known as EsounD and ESD) was one of the original audio output modules for Linux included since VLC's infancy. {{docmod|arts}} and the esd plugin were removed prior to VLC 1.0.0, because both projects were inactive.

Modern Linux users can use the {{docmod|pulse}} or {{docmod|jack}} modules instead. There are probably others.
