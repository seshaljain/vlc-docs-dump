Thanks for the nice wiki page! (We desperately need stuff like that for the documentation ... once we start writing it seriously)
Anyway, about your "deinterlacing non-interlaced pictures", I agree that it's kind of stupid. I'll probably change it so it just keeps the same picture when the input isn't interlaced.

:I don't know whether it is possible for VLC to determine which videos are interlaced and which are not.  But if it is, then it would surely be a great feature. [[User:Rune Kock|Rune Kock]] 21:01, 8 January 2008 (CET)

::Sure it's possible (each picture has a flag to tell if it's progressive or interlaced, plus some extra info about which lines come first for interlaced pictures). [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 10:19, 9 January 2008 (CET)
