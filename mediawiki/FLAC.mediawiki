'''FLAC''' is short for '''Free Lossless Audio Compression'''. It is an open source [[codec]] and [[file format]] which provides a [[lossless|perfect]] quality audio file. FLAC files usually contain [[CD|CD quality]] audio, but can also support almost any audio data with a wide range of sample frequencies, amount of channels and bits per sample. 

FLAC provides a smaller size of file than [[PCM]] [[WAV]] (about half the size), but much larger than [[lossy]] codecs like [[MP3]]. MP3s are about 5-10% the size of WAV files, but are lower quality.

A CD's worth of data is...
* 700MB as a CD
* 700MB as WAV
* '''300MB as FLAC'''
* 40MB as MP3 (128 [[kbps]])

== Container format ==
{{mux|id=flac|encoder=y}}
FLAC can be used inside several [[container format]]s, such as [[ogg]] and [[matroska]], but can also be stored in its own container.

{{VLC}} can encode FLAC starting with 0.7.0.
