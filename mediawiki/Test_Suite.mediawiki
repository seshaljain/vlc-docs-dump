== Intro ==
We need a better test suite

== What exists ==

=== autotools test suite ===
Currently you can run the following command to run the vlc tests
 $ make check

=== /tests ===
To run these tests just use the driver shell script in that directory:
 $ ./test.sh

There are more tests in /modules/misc/tests.  -- ''How to run them?'' [[User:Pdherbemont|Pdherbemont]] 10:37, 27 February 2008 (CET)

== Goals ==
* Core tests: Make sure the regular operation from VLC's core don't crash.
* API tests: Make sure the regular operation from VLC's core don't crash.
* General stability tests: Run some every day operation and see if it crashes.
* Codec/muxer/modules test: Perform tests on modules to see if they actually works, that means see if their output is what there are ought to be
* Interface tests: Run some every day gui operation and see if it crashes.
