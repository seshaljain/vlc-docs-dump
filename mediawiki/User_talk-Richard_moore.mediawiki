Vlc is very complicated for a novice like me. But I heard it was the best & I want the best. Having a lot of difficulty putting into operation. Also every movie I want to view on various sites won't unless I download their player. Should I have to download every movie sites player? Am I doing something wrong? Sorry I'm not very good on computers. Just want to watch some movies for free.
