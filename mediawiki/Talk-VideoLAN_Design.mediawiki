==Wiki vs. Doc pages==
I've been messing with the http interface and noticed quite a variation in the information available from the videolan/doc/ area compared to wiki.videolan.org.  Is there a migration progress likely?  This discussion page seems as good as any to find out about the plans for the wiki, although I'm not sure why the talk page was previously deleted.  Anyway, the wiki seems much more comprehensive and up to date - some of the http interface info in the wiki is scattered across several articles, but that's easily fixable.  Look forward to updating it, if that's going to be useful. --[[User:Gth|Gth]] 07:59, 25 April 2012 (CEST)
:videolan/doc/ was the very old documentation that has not been updated since like VLC 0.8/0.9 or something. This wiki (wiki.videolan.org) is the more up to date version of the documentation. [[User:Edwardw|Edwardw]] 04:22, 28 April 2012 (CEST)
