{{protocol|file}}
The '''file''' protocol plays files on your PC through the normal file system. This includes your hard drive and any data [[CD]]s or data [[DVD]]s you have (in [[Linux]], these must be [[wikipedia:Mount (computing)|mounted]] before use).

For example:
 {{%}} vlc "file://C:\My Music\Abracadabra.mp3"
If no other protocols are used, file:// is assumed:
 % vlc "C:\My Music\Abracadabra.mp3"
