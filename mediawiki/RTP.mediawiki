'''RTP''' or '''Real-time Transport Protocol''' is a [[protocol]] for streaming media (including [[VoIP]] and video teleconferencing) over the Internet. [[RTCP]] is used alongside this protocol to give feedback on the quality of the connection and [[RTSP]] changes streaming aspects of the connection.<br />
For example, RTP might stream a video, RTCP might show dropped frames, and RTSP might pause the video playback.<br />
RTP is often layered on top of [[UDP]] because UDP is quicker than [[TCP]].

VLC has built-in support for RTP as a server (streaming output). As a client, VLC uses the [[LiveMedia]] library.

RTP is generic and is extensible through profiles. '''RTP/AVP''' or '''RTP Audio Video Profile''' is a ''profile'' for RTP specific for live multimedia streams. RTP/AVP requires a specified ''payload format'' to establish which [[codec]]s will be used. Each has a dedicated RFC, e.g. [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6184 RFC 6184] for [[H.264]] payload format.
