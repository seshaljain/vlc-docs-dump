== Playlist not played in order ==

I have created a playlist and saved it to an *.m3u file.  The list has five *.mp4 files to play from the playlist.  When I click on the m3u file to play, it does not play the files on the list in the order in which they exist on the list, top to bottom.  Instead they jump around from one file to another and seem to play in no particular order.  I would think that they would play from top down in the playlist, but they do not.
