{{wikipedia|Resource Interchange File Format}}
'''RIFF''', the '''Resource Interchange File Format''', is a format which stores data as chunks. RIFF files may store audio in one chunk, video in another, and meta information in a third. It uses [[FourCC]]s to distinguish between different chunks and codecs.

RIFF files start with the magic id "RIFF". RIFF is the underlying format for [[WAVE]] and [[AVI]] files.
