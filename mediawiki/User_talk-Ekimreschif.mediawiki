== I deleted the page you started ==

Hello,

I understand in January 2014 you started the page [[VSG:Installation:iOS]] with content of <pre>Installing issu ios7</pre>

I deleted it because pages in the ''VLC Support Guide'' are expected to provide information to resolve issues.<br />
If you would like to write the page&mdash;great!&mdash;but I think an empty page will be misleading to readers.<br />
If you are seeking help, read [[Documentation:iOS]] or browse [https://forum.videolan.org/viewforum.php?f=36 the iOS section of the forum].
