Could this be added to the Documentation/Module:logo (or whatever it's named) page instead ? [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 11:50, 12 February 2007 (CET)

Well, it should be added, you are right, but not removed from here.
HowTo pages should grow in size, not diminuish.[[User:J-b|J-b]] 15:02, 12 February 2007 (CET)
