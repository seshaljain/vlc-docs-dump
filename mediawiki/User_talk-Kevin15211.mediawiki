Dears:
I use vlc to stream out digi-TV signal(mpeg2-TS) with udp protocol.
I want to multicast it
I use command line to start VLC,like that

"C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe" dvb-t:// :dvb-frequency=533000000 :dvb-bandwidth=6 --ts-es-id-pid --programs="100,101,102" :sout=#duplicate{dst=udp{dst=224.0.0.0:8056},select="program=100",dst=udp{dst=224.0.0.0:8057},select="program=101",dst=udp{dst=224.0.0.0:8058},select="program=102"} :ttl=16 :sout-keep  

the ip where i had use multicast address,but why i still can't do it.
My thought is that the server sent the package to the multicast address(224.0.0.0),and ClientA connect to it,so does Client B.
But I just can't!!!!
AM I worng??
can somebody can tell me what can i do resolve the question. Thanks a lot.

I am so sorry about my poor English.
