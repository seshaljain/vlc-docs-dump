==Stream a file with VLC==

 {{%}} '''vlc -vvv video1.xyz --sout udp:192.168.0.42 --ttl 12'''
where:
* '''video1.xyz''' is the file you want to stream,
* '''192.168.0.42''' is either:
** the [[IP address]] of the machine you want to [[unicast]] to;
** or the DNS name the machine you want to unicast to;
** or a [[multicast]] IP address.
* '''12''' is the value of the [[TTL]] (Time To Live) of your IP packets (which means that the stream will be able to cross 11 routers).

If you want to stream the file continuously, add the '''--loop''' option.

Of course, you can add more options (like [[transcoding]], or streaming to a TCP port, etc.), but this should get you started.
