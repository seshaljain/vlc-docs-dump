The following is the simplest way to use [[libvlc]] with visual C++.
What you need is: libvlc.dll and the whole folder plugins; Copy the dll file and plugins folder into your Debug or Release directory.

# Create VC console project
# Implement some functions to load libvlc.dll into your application:
#: Take a look at [http://www.videolan.org/developers/vlc/doc/doxygen/html/group__libvlc__old.html] to get more information about functions in libvlc.dll
# Create a command that is used to pass to libvlc.dll
This command is used to stream webcam to another machine:
   char ** commands = new char*[6];
   commands[0] = "testvlcconsole.exe"; //your application name
   commands[1] = "dshow://";
   commands[2] = ":dshow-vdev=Logitech QuickCam Pro 3000 (08B0)";
   commands[3] = ":dshow-adev=";
   commands[4] = ":dshow-size=176x144";
   commands[5] = ":sout=#transcode{vcodec=h264,vb=1024,scale=1}:duplicate{dst=std{access=udp,mux=ts,dst=192.168.0.155:1234}}";

4. Main program:
 - Initialize Library : load libvlc.dll and its functions
 - Create VLC instance: id  = VLC_Create()
 - Initialize VLC : VLC_Init(id, int, commands)
 - Start playing: VLC_Play()
