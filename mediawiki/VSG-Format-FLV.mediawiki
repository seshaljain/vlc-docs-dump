== Trouble playing Flash Video Files<br>  ==

<br> 

Flash Video support has been added (provided through ffmpeg). 

To view [[.flv]] files you will need version 0.8.4a. Download and install the latest version [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ here].<br> 

VLC still has problems with a few .flv files. If you have problems playing a file in VLC you might be able to change it to an [[avi]] using [[ffmpeg]]. See [[VLC HowTo/Transcode from Flash Video format]]. 

<br>VLC 0.8.6 provided enhanced Flash Video support on all platforms, so it is probably worth to update if you experience problems with prior releases.<br>
