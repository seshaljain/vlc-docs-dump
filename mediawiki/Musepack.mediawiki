'''Musepack''' ('''MPC''') is a [[lossy]] [[VBR]] audio codec based on the [[MP2]] codec that aims to [[compress]]/decompress faster than [[mp3]] or [[AAC]] while maintaining high sound quality.

Support for Musepack was added in VLC 0.8.4, and both formats (S7 and S8) have been [[supported]] since 1.1.6 (according to [https://www.musepack.net/index.php?pg=new Musepack: A wake up call and VLC support]).
