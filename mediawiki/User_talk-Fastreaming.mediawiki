Hi, guys!

I wanna build a full checkout vlc by Visual Studio 2005

I will reference the older version 0.86c to reconstruct a whole VS2005 project from scratch

Could anyone can deliver any valuable information on this topic? I searched the official VLC forum,and found nothing

Any addtitionl help will be appreciated!
Thanks

You can't build VLC with MSVC. [[User:J-b|jb]] 14:59, 29 September 2007 (CEST)

Why?
Are there any ugly gcc-extended C/C++ syntaxs which fail to compile directly by VS2005?

I am sure that I can build VLC by VS2005, I will pay attention to this topic in next two months
