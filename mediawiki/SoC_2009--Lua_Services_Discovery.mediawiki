==Project Abstract==
:The main goal of this project will be giving VideoLAN a Lua framework to load scriptable services discovery, to make them easier to write, if they don't require C complexity.
:Second goal will be giving VideoLAN access to a great number of online music and video services, like Jamendo, Magnatune, youtube, Dailymotion, etc..., using the new Lua modules.

The planning is still a little vague, i still don't know examination dates, so it's just a guess, but i don't think to have big problems on working during that period (probably just a break the day of the exam or the day before...)
