libdvdnav and libdvdread are ([[VideoLAN]]) [[libraries]] for [[DVD]] navigation based off the earlier code of the [[Ogle]] project:
* libdvdnav is for complex navigation (DVDs with menus and other features)
* libdvdread is for simpler navigation (DVDs without menus)

As described by the developer documentation ''[https://www.videolan.org/developers/libdvdnav.html libdvdnav & libdvdread]'' on videolan.org:
<blockquote>libdvdnav is a library for developers of multimedia applications. It allows easy use of sophisticated DVD navigation features such as DVD menus, multiangle playback and even interactive DVD games. All this functionality is provided through a simple {{API}} which provides the DVD playback as a single logical stream of blocks, intermitted by special dvdnav events to report certain conditions. The main usage of libdvdnav is a loop regularly calling a function to get the next block, surrounded by additional calls to tell the library of user interaction. The whole DVD virtual machine and internal playback states are completely encapsulated.</blockquote>
