'''High Efficiency Video Coding''' or '''HEVC''' is the upcoming successor to H.264. It is sometimes (unofficially) called '''H.265''' or '''H.265/HEVC''' to lend an idea that it builds upon [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]].

It claims a greater [[compression]] ratio through [[lossy]] means at no cost to apparent fidelity. The first version was released in April 2013, though new standards are still being developed.

Like H.264, it is encumbered with patents. The [[open source]] version is [[x265]].

In {{VLC}}, although {{docmod|h26x}} is used to decode it, {{docmod|x265}} is used to encode it.
