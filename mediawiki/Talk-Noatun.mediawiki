== Proposing deletion ==
I'm proposing deletion of this page and talk page, but archival would also be okay. [[wikipedia:KDE_2#K_Desktop_Environment_2.1|KDE 2.1]] was released February 2001. It's not current and doesn't have an entry on Wikipedia or KDE.org. Do we keep these things as reference, or do we delete these pages? {{User:DoesItReallyMatter/real_sig}} 06:10, 23 January 2019 (CET)
