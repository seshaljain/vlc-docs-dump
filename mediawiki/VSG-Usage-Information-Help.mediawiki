== Use VLC's help documentation<br>  ==

If you can't find anything about your particular problem in the internet, you should try the function VLC has for the command line. 

<br> 

Open your command-line and write “'''vlc –help'''” in it. 

You´ll now have a .TXT file created, which contains VLCs command-line options. Your screen will now show you a list, which you can browse through to find your problem. 

<br> 

If you still cannot solve your problem try to write the following in the command-line. 
<pre>“vlc -p module –advanced” 
</pre> 
<br>
