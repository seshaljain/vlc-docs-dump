== How can I make VLC to preview my eMule downloads?  ==

<br> 

You have got two ways to do this: 

Either go to your eMule temp folder and double click on a 001 part file. Then set VLC to be the default application. 

<br> 

Or, you can go to your eMule options and select the menu name files. 

You should see something that says video player with a folder beside it. Click on the folder and then locate where the vlc.exe file is.<br> 

For example: 
<pre>C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe</pre> 
After this VLC should be able to preview eMule downloads.<br> 

<br> 

Also look for something in your emule options that allows you to tell eMule to preview chucks first.<br>
