Those are the {{VLC}} mobile recommendations for the video player interface.

= Gestures =
* single-tap => display the UI
* double-finger tap => play/pause
* swipe left/right => seek
* swipe up/down => volume on right side, brightness on left side
** double-finger swipe => so far nothing, could be longer seek

= Hardware buttons =
Control of the volume of media or the application

= Buttons / Controls =

== Left upper corner ==
* Stop/quit button

== Controller at the bottom middle ==
This must be semi-transparent, (with blur on iOS).

In order of importance:
* Widest Seek Slider as possible, with time indicators (recommended on both sides) (except iOS, where this is at the top)
* Play/Pause button
* Lock button (rotation + touch)
* Access to Audio/Subtitles tracks selector HUD
** Including addition of subtitles if it makes sense (WP)
* Aspect Ratio Button (Pan/Scan)
* Access to extra panel for extra features
* OPTIONAL Next/Previous button if video playlist
* OPTIONAL DVD menu button? (rare, missing libVLC)

== Extra Panels ==
* Speed selector
* Sync Audio Video Subtitles tracks
* Video filters
* EQ or other audio filters
* Chapters selection
* Snapshot ??
* Access to prefs? Like for subtitles look control?
