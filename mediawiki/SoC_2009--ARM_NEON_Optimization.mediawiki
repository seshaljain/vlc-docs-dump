== Abstract ==
Formerly used primarily in PDAs and cellphones, ARM is starting to target netbooks and laptops with its new Cortex-A series of processors. One key feature of these new processors is the NEON SIMD unit, the use of which will massively boost the performance of many multimedia applications. This project will consist of writing NEON/ARMv6 SIMD assembly for all of the major DSP functions in x264, ideally speeding x264 up by over 4-5 times.

|23 || ARMv6 optimizations ||style="background: #ffff00"| In progress || For smaller functions, write code using ARMv6's simd extensions. For instance, ARMv6 SAD width 4 is faster on Cortex-A8.
|-
|24 || Cortex-A9 optimizations ||style="background: #ffff00"| In progress || Primarily consists of running checkasm --bench on an A9, noting whether ARMv6 or NEON is faster, figuring out why, and ensuring that the faster function is selected.
|-
|25 || gcc optimization || Not Started || Investigate what gcc produces for important C functions and attempt to optimize it for ARM
|-
|26 || Performance Counter Optimization || Not Started || Utilize the ARMv7 performance counters to optimize stalls, cache usage, NEON->ARM data hazards, and more

== Repository ==
I'm currently using gitorious to publish my work [http://gitorious.org/projects/x264-arm]

== Timeline ==
This is an estimation.

'''March-April''' Qualifying task, work on the more important (>5% in profiles) functions

'''May''' Final projects and exams

''' May 23''' Program Starts

''' May 23 - June 14''' Code

''' June 15 - June 21''' Vacation on Chincoteague

''' June 22 - July 12''' Code

''' July 13''' Mid Term deadline. Specific goals pending, but I'd like to have none of the functions without asm equivalents to be more than about 2% of common profiles. In other words, all the major functions would have been written in NEON ASM

''' July 13 - August 17''' Code

'''August 17''' Program end
