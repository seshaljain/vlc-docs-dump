There will be a bus that will be responsible for bringing everyone to and back from the park. More details on the park are available below.

Notes:
* that bus and park entrance fees are paid by us, so there are NO costs with the exception of food and drinks
* do not burden yourself too much with unneeded stuff and particularly '''don't bring your laptop'''!
