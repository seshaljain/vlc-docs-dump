I learned of VideoLAN as an alternative for the CCCP from Dattebayo when Shippuuden switched over on 54, so I have downloaded it as an additional option and would like to learn more about this, so I signed up for the wiki to make any minor edits I might notice as I read through it, until I can become more competant and informed regarding it.
