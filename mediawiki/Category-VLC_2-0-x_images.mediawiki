Also known as [[Twoflower]] (see also: [[VLC CodeNames]]).

There was no 1.2.x release (see [https://download.videolan.org/vlc/ release archive]); anything that claims to be 1.2.x refers to the pre-release (see [https://download.videolan.org/testing/ testing archive]) that was developed into 2.0.0. The pre-release images will probably look identical to the 2.0.x images, but have [[:Category:VLC 1.2.0-pre images|a separate category]].
