Two simple steps are needed to access macmini buildbot, which is connected to altair via VPN service.

==SSH access==

 ssh -N -f -L 10022:10.8.0.10:22 videolan@altair.videolan.org 

 ssh -p 10022 videolan@localhost

where 10022 is the local port on your machine, 10.8.0.10 is the IP address of macmini, and 22 is the port macmini's sshd listens on.

==VNC/RDP access==

 ssh -N -f -L 15900:10.8.0.10:5900 videolan@altair.videolan.org

Then, in your VNC/RDP client application, open localhost:15900.
