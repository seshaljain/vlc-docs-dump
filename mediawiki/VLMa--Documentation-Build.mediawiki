= VLMa build HOWTO =

== Requirements ==

You need the following softwares to build VLMa:

* A Java SDK version 5.0 or higher

You can check whether your Java installation is suitable by checking that the ''javac'' executable is available and that the version is higher than 5.0 (''javac -version'').

* [http://maven.apache.org Maven 2]

VLMa uses Maven as a build system. If you are not familiar with this tool, check the [http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html 5 minutes guide].

* VLMa source tree

You can either download the latest tarballs at http://www.videolan.org/vlma/download.html and extract them or check out the development tree using [[Git]]

 $ git clone git://git.videolan.org/vlma.git

== Build ==

Once you have downloaded VLMa source code, change directory to the root of the project and type:

 $ mvn install

Maven will download VLMa dependencies and build the project according to the configuration located in the pom.xml files.

This method is currently not working(17/08/2014). Maven returns dependency errors during VLMa Core building. vthr.videolan.org is unknown host. At the moment theres no way known to build.
