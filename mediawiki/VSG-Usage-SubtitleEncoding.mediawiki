If you see wrong characters on screen or failed to convert subtitle encoding error message you should try to change Subtitles text encoding option which can be found from Tools -> Preferences (set Show Settings to All) and Input / Codecs -> Other codecs -> Subtitles. Remember to press Save to save VLC settings and restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled.
