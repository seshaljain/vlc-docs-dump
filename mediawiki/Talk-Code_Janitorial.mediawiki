= Testimonial =
VLC is definitely a great software but the most difficult step for a new coming programmer is getting into the code for sure. Having spent almost one full-time month trying to understand precise parts of the code (basically RTSP, HTTP and RTP modules) I can swear that the lack of documentation and comments is a real issue in the project.

= Funny requirement =
More over, but this is completely off-topic for sure, it that the team-developers (the ones with a write access to the SVN repository I mean) requires patchers to comment they patches, but some of them don't even comment the code their commit :-/ It would take them some time of course, but will certainly save thousand times more for others...

= Improvement proposition =
In my opinion, VLC comments should be written in Doxygen (or similar) to be able to generate code documentation on the fly. In this case, this page could be improve by providing basic examples of most used and common Doxygen (for instance) tags to produce such comments. There also is an emacs configuration file (probably there also is one for vi/vim) providing bindings to generate comments skeletons to be filled, which makes writing Doxygen comments as easy as writing regular comments.
