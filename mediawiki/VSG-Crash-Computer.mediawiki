== VLC crashes / freezes / BSODs my computer<br>  ==

<br> 

VLC doesn't do that. Normal apps shouldn't be able to cause issues like these to operating systems. <br> 

Culprit is usually bad device driver (for example display adapter driver, soundcard driver, chipset driver, network adapter driver etc.) or broken hardware.<br><br>If you still cannot trace out the problem then try resetting VLC Settings by the following procedure:<br> 

If you can start VLC, go to '''Tools''' -&gt; '''Preferences''' and then press '''Reset Preferences'''. '''Save''' to reset and save VLC settings. 

Remember to restart VLC after that to make sure changes are enabled. 

<br> 

If you can't start VLC, go to '''%appdata%''' folder and delete '''vlc''' folder from there.<br>
