=Enhancing VLMC=

==Abstract==

The aim of this project is to provide a functionnal workflow for the VLMC project, including the transition and effects API, in order to allow external developpers to create new effects.
At the moment, VLMC isn't abble to generate a video output. After this summer, it (hopefully) will :)

The workflow consists of 5 differents workflows :
* The main workflow
* The clip workflow
* The track workflow
* The effects workflow
* The transition workflow

Basically, the main workflow will query the track workflow, which will query the clip workflow for each clip contained in the so called track.
Transitions and effect workflow will query transition and effects modules at different points, from the precedently described workflows.

==Timeline==

'''May 26''' Here we go !

'''June 06''' Functionnal clip workflow

'''June 13''' Functionnal track workflow

'''June 19''' Some small vacation

'''July 01''' Let's get back coding !

'''July 04''' Main workflow

Having a look at the code efficiency would be good. At this point, real time is almost mandatory.

'''July 07''' Mid term evaluation

'''July 25''' Effect and transition API

'''August 01''' Functionnal effect workflow

'''August 08''' Functionnal transition workflow

'''August 11''' Check code, write doc, beeing nervous if work isn't done.

'''August 18''' Keyboard pencil down :(

'''August 18/19''' Let's party o//
