'''SVCD''', or '''Super Video CD''' is a way of storing a video on a [[CD]] in a similar way to storing it on a [[DVD]]. It is (of course) generally lower quality than a DVD due to the smaller size of a CD rather than a DVD.

==Compatibility==
SVCDs often do not work in VLC Player. VLC can sometimes play SVCDs using [[libcdio]] and [[libvcdinfo]] - the [http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html features] page has more details. For a complete VCD/SVCD which includes menu selections, hot spots and playback control, see [http://www.xinehq.de xine].
