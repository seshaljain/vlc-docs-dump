Hé man, when you do things like [http://trac.videolan.org/vlc/changeset/20853 that] think about doing those http://wiki.videolan.org/index.php?title=Contrib_Status&diff=9580&oldid=9534 ! Thanks [[User:J-b|jb]] 10:38, 23 July 2007 (CEST)
Ok, I haven't heard about this page. Thanks jb!


== Editing in the documentation namespace ==
Pierre, Please read [[Documentation:EditingGuidelines]]. Specifically: the documentation shouldn't link outside of the documentation. I guess that you could just move the pages arround. [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 16:04, 1 February 2008 (CET)

== VLC OS X ==

It looks to me like you're at least working on the OS X version of VLC, and thus may at least know who else I should talk to about this.

I was wondering if you guys had specifically decided not to use the Sparkle framework for updating the app for some reason.  If that's not the case, I would be interested in seeing about adding the Sparkle framework to the program, and was wondering who I should talk to to go about starting doing that.

Anyways, let me know if I should talk to someone else about it, or how I should go about doing this.  Thanks! [[User:Alpha dk|Alpha dk]] 02:18, 30 September 2008 (CEST)

We are effectively interested in using the Sparkle framework (at least two of us). Though I don't think we have the time/will to do it.
