'''MP3''' is a popular type of audio [[compression]] described by the [[MPEG-1]] specification (MP3's full name is ''MPEG-1 Layer 3 Audio'').

VLC can play and create MP3 files.

== Creating mp3 files ==
: '''Note:''' If you try to create mp3 files it probably won't use the best compression techniques! A better alternative is to use the [[wikipedia:LAME|LAME]] MP3 encoder.

You can make mp3 files by using the ''mp3'' audio codec. .mp3 files do not have a container, so you should use the ''[[dummy]]'' container. You should also specify the <code>--no-video</code> option if you're taking audio from a video.

An example of this at the [[command prompt]] is:
 {{%}} vlc "''input_file''" :no-video :sout=#transcode{acodec=mp3,ab=128}:std{access=file,mux=dummy,dst="''out_file.mp3''"}
