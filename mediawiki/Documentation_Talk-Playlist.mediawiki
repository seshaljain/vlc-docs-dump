==No playlist buttons==
The randomizing instructions here don't make any sense for any version of VLC I can recall.  I'm using 2.1.5 on Mac OS X, and the playlist window has no such buttons as those described under [[Documentation:Playlist#Add Media Files to Playlist]].  The playlist seems to auto-randomize.  This can be controlled (along with repeat one, repeat all, etc.) only from the "Playback" menu. [[User:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish]] ([[User talk:SMcCandlish|talk]]) 08:14, 25 August 2014 (CEST)

Have a look at the View menu. It lets you add those buttons to the main and playback windows. For further support, consider posting on http://forum.videolan.org --[[User:Fkuehne|feepk]] ([[User talk:Fkuehne|talk]]) 00:19, 1 September 2014 (CEST)
