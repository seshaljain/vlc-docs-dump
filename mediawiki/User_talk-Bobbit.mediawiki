Hi,
Ive just started using VLC and am enjoying it alot. Im pretty inexperienced with this kind of thing though and am learning as much as I can through the forum. I have two questions though which maybe somebody could help me out with.

I recently pushed a button in VLC, which has put a short lived overlay over the front of one of my .avi files (only when played in WMP for some reason, containing all the codec info etc). I quite like this and would like to know which button it was I pressed as I think this info could come in handy with my second problem.

My second problem is that I have alot of .avi files which my old fashioned DVD player tells me (and judging by the file size) my computer has confirmed are in HD. When I've tried to burn them the DVD player says either "Check disc" or "HD not recognised on this device" or something similiar. Ive tried alot of re-formatting programs such as Prism, and Formatfactory with no luck. Ive tried one called by effectmatrix or some similiar sounding company, unfortunately the free version leaves a watermark over the final file, but it does play for some reason. 

Any suggestions you could offer would be great. 

Thanks

Bobbit
