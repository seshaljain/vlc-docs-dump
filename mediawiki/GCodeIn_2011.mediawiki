This page is about gathering '''ideas''' for the VideoLAN project for acceptance in the [http://code.google.com/opensource/gci/2011-12/index.html Google Code In 2011-2012] program.

VideoLAN has been part of [http://code.google.com/soc/ Google Summer of Code] in [[SoC_2007|2007]], [[SoC_2008|2008]], [[SoC_2009|2009]] and [[SoC_2010|2010]].

[[x264 GCodeIn Ideas|x264]] is also participating in Videolan's Code-In.

This is a temporary page for listing ideas for Google Code-in tasks. 

The final tasks will be moved to melange, when needed.

The list is being migrated to a google doc for ease of importing/processing.

'''Tools''':  <br>
'''Time''':  <br>
'''Mentor''':  <br>

'''Outcome''': Create a new preset that gets accepted into libav <br>
'''Difficulty''':  <br>
'''Tools''':  <br>
'''Time''':  <br>
'''Mentor''':  <br>

'''Difficulty''':  <br>
'''Tools''':  <br>
'''Time''':  <br>
'''Mentor''':  <br>

=== Fuzzing existing crashers ===
'''Category''': Quality Assurance <br>
'''Description''': A wide range of projects use libav, and some of them maintain bugtrackers or forums which contain records of crashing files <br>
It would be nice to know if those files still crash libav, and if fuzzing them creates a new crash <br>

'''Time''':  <br>
'''Mentor''':  <br>

=== Find a new audio codec ===
'''Category''': Research <br>

Undoubtedly though, there are still more out there that are not yet known or documented <br>
'''Outcome''': Find a currently unknown audio codec and provide information about it so it can be eventually supported <br>
This information should include the following: <br>
*Audio codec name <br>
*How to identify this type (twoCC, a file header or a distinctive file extension usually) <br>
*Samples, ideally made from lossless source and details on any features used if known <br>
