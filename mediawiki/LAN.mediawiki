A '''local area network''' or '''LAN''' links together a limited number of individual computers. Examples include home, library and small campus networks. In most cases this network will sit "behind" a router for Internet access.

The name ''[[VideoLAN]]'' is in reference to the initial project to [[stream]] ''video'' and audio to every computer attached to a ''LAN''.

Projects that can be used for network streaming include:
