I see that you've been working on the main page. Would you like to have access to the real main page in order to change it instead of a copy ? [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 21:44, 14 January 2006 (CET)

: I think the page is pretty much finished (so if you only want to copy it that's fine), but it would be quite useful to have access to it in case I need to change anything --[[User:H2g2bob|H2g2bob]] 21:53, 14 January 2006 (CET)

:: I installed the wikimedia SpamBlacklist filter so it should be ok to unprotect the Main Page. You can now edit it [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 22:10, 14 January 2006 (CET)

::: Brilliant: thank you. Just copied it over now --[[User:H2g2bob|H2g2bob]] 22:20, 14 January 2006 (CET)

Is there any way to become an admin (sysop) for this site - it would be nice to be able to change pages like [[Help:Contents]] to have something on them. --[[User:H2g2bob|H2g2bob]] 19:06, 16 January 2006 (CET)

: there you go :) Thanks for the help btw. [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 23:41, 16 January 2006 (CET)

I started a bit of cleanup of the Main Page, and would like to clean a bit more all the wiki. What do you think of it ? [[User:J-b|J-b]] 02:28, 15 December 2006 (CET)
: That's pretty good - it's a bit more ordered now, so much better for finding where you want to go. I shifted the "help the project" bit up to be directly under the "support/get help", as it was quite a bit below on my screen. It certainly gets the h2g2bob [[wikipedia:WP:BARN|barnstar]] of approval! --[[User:H2g2bob|h2g2bob]] 06:40, 15 December 2006 (CET)
:: Thanks, I was not able to do that correctly, I was not really aware of the wiki syntax. I am discovering it. So now, the following tasks are to clean the rest of the wiki. I think a Portal:Developers would be a good idea, don't you think ? What about a greater use of categories. And report the Wikipedia description of VLC here ? [[User:J-b|J-b]] 11:35, 15 December 2006 (CET)
::: Wouldn't Portal:Developers just be [[Developers Corner]] :-) Categories is a must: I think it would be easiest to add them through templates, eg a template for muxers like [[ASF]] and [[AVI]] saying what their name is when you use them in the command line. --[[User:H2g2bob|h2g2bob]] 02:01, 16 December 2006 (CET)
:::: Ok. You are right. I'll try to understand templates  [[User:J-b|J-b]] 19:13, 16 December 2006 (CET)
:::: I finished the Developers corner. And I try to reduce the number of orphan page. It seems that your talk page is becoming a redesignWiki Page. good night [[User:J-b|J-b]] 03:57, 17 December 2006 (CET)

: I added a [[Template:mux]] for [[container]] formats (eg: [[ogg]], [[mkv]]). I was thinking that perhaps a similar thing would work for video / audio codecs, but have them all different colours or something. Any views on whether this is a good thing, or what else could be done to it? --[[User:H2g2bob|h2g2bob]] 03:37, 16 December 2006 (CET)
:: I think it is a good thing. But would it be used ? [[User:J-b|J-b]] 19:13, 16 December 2006 (CET)
: I changed the left menu. Comments ? A lot of more work to do ![[User:J-b|J-b]] 19:13, 16 December 2006 (CET)
:: I think that's better too - I like the way it's split, it makes sense. --[[User:H2g2bob|h2g2bob]] 23:17, 16 December 2006 (CET)

== VideoLAN team map ==
Hi. I've added a VideoLAN team map on http://www.videolan.org/team/. I'd be glad to add you to the map if you want to. Have a look at http://www.videolan.org/team/team.xml to see what data is required (latitude and longitude can be found on http://maps.google.com, the ll=<lat>,<lon> value in the URL).
