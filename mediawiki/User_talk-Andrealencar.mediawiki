Hello,

I reverted your edits at [[VLC Awards]] because I did not feel it to be appropriate for the list of awards: although the site does speak positively of VLC media player, it does not visibly review VLC other than a few user-submitted star rankings. The page you edited is aimed more at large numbers of user-submitted reviews, frequently-trafficked sites, or critics' analysis of the software.

I can be reached for comment, if necessary, at [[User talk:DoesItReallyMatter]]
