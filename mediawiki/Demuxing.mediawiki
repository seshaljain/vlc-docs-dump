'''Demuxing''' is an abbreviation of '''demultiplexing'''. Demuxing is the process of reading a multi-part stream and saving each part&nbsp;&ndash; audio, video, and subtitles (if any)&nbsp;&ndash; as a separate stream. It is the logical reverse of the [[muxing]] process.

For example, [[AVI]] is a container that means ''audio-video interleave''. The processing of demuxing an AVI requires separating the ''audio'' and ''visual'' components so (after being decoded by other modules) they can finally reach the speaker and monitor, respectively.

Most media file formats are multiplexed together in this way and VLC uses ''demuxer'' modules to separate them. Examples of demuxers that VLC uses are [[Documentation:Modules/asf|asf]] (for [[ASF]]), [[Documentation:Modules/ogg|ogg]] (for [[Ogg]]) and [[Documentation:Modules/mkv|mkv]] (for [[Matroska]]).
