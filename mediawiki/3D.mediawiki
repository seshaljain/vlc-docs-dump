{{Howto|to use VLC to watch 3D video}}

==3D Display Technologies==

Generally there are three widely use 3D display technologies, all based on the principles of stereoscopic projection:

* [[wikipedia:Anaglyph image|Anaglyph]] - red/green or red/blue images with glasses filtering out one colour or the other
* Polarisation - technique used in cinemas, with two images projected with different polarisations, a silvered screen and polarised glasses <br> Also TV sets are capable of producing polarized light; they use interlaced displays for the left and right pictures, the even lines and the odd lines differently polarized (which effectively halves the vertical resolution in 3D mode)
* [[wikipedia:Liquid crystal shutter glasses|Shutter Glasses]] - technique used by the new 3D televisions, where each alternating frame represent the left or right views.

==How to view 3D videos in VLC==
VLC since 2.1.0 has built-in support for viewing '''3D side-by-side (SBS)''' videos using '''anaglyph''' technology.

See [[Documentation:Modules/anaglyph]].
