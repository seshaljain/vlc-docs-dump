{{mux|id=pva|encoder=n}}

PVA is the extension denoting [[Packetize]]d Elementary Streams (PES) containing both video and audio. PES files are muxed [[elementary stream]]s. By their nature elementary streams are only audio or video files. However, by recording [[timestamp]]s PVA files can contain both with a low overhead for [[muxing]] real-time [[MPEG-2 video]] with [[AC3]] Dolby Digital audio. Such files are often recorded with Digital Video Broadcast [[DVB]] capturing software.
