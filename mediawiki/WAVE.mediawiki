{{mux|id=wav|encoder=y}}

'''WAVE''' is a way of storing audio, which is normally [[raw|uncompressed]]. It is based on [[RIFF]].  Note that wav isn't a streamable audio format, so you can only stream it using [[RTP]] (to stream it otherwise, transcode it to something that's streamable).

== Accepted audio codecs ==
* [[dummy]]: Uncompressed audio of various types, based on storing integer values of the amplitude of the sound (see [[wikipedia:PCM|PCM]]).
* [[fl32]]: Floating point 32-bit uncompressed audio, also based on PCM but allowing the values to be stored as floating point data types. This can give better quality audio when the sound becomes quiet.

== Converting to WAVE ==

The command-line for [[convert]]ing any readable input file to a WAVE audio file is the following:

 {{%}} {{font colour|grey|vlc}} -I dummy -vv {{font colour|green|"input.mp3"}} --sout=#transcode{acodec={{font colour|red|s16l}},channels=2,ab={{font colour|purple|128}},samplerate=44100}:standard{access=file,mux=wav,dst={{font colour|blue|"output.wav"}}} vlc://quit

Where on Windows you need to add installation directory in front of {{font colour|grey|vlc}} (by default {{font colour|grey|{{Path to VLC|windows|dir=y}}}}).

As {{font colour|red|audio codec (acodec)}} you can specify one of the above mentioned ones. The [[bitrate]] of the output file is specified by the {{font colour|purple|ab}} parameter.
