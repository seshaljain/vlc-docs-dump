Some1, on the mini tasks it said there was a request for Windows remote compatibility.  The easiest way to do this is to receive the WM_APPACTIVATE in a Windows message loop and check the wParam and lParam arguments to determine what kind of message was received.  This will also enable VLC to work with media keyboards.  I will see what I can do personally with the code. [[User:Stinkman|Stinkman]] 00:25, 4 November 2007 (CET)
