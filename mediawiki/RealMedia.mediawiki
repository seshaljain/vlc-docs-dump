'''RealMedia''' is a type of file designed by RealNetworks, and can be played with the proprietary [[RealPlayer]]. RealPlayer is available for [[Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]. Additionally, [[Helix Player]] may be able to play some files, but it lacks the proprietary codecs in some realmedia files.

RealMedia files are normally streamed over [[RTSP]] connections.

RealAlternative installs, and allows RealMedia files to be played in [[Media Player Classic]].

==Accepted codecs==
* [[rv]]: RealVideo
* [[ra]]: [[MPEG-4]] audio
* [[a52]], [[dnet]]: A/52 audio
* [[cook]]: Cook audio codec
* [[28_8]]: 28.8 audio codec
* [[sipr]], RealAudio 4/5 (name is from Sipro Lab Telecom ACELP-NET)

==Compatibility==
Currently, [[VLC media player]] should be able to play most audio and video of .rm, .rmvb files.

Sipr is supported through [[libavcodec]] (Search for sipr in either of these files: [https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob;f=Changelog;hb=HEAD][https://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=blob;f=modules/codec/avcodec/fourcc.c]. It is not mentioned in {{VLCSourceFile|NEWS}})
