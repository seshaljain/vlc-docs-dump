== Dummy vs. Raw Container ==

When I want to transcode a file into MP3 using the Export/Streaming Wizard, the '''codec''' should be set to ''MP3'' and the '''container format''' to ''raw''. Raw might be a dummy, but the description in the article is a bit confusing because there is also a dummy codec. --[[User:Robb Dub Funk|Robb Dub Funk]] 22:16, 28 August 2007 (CEST)
: I kind of agree. (although both might be valid solutions ... but I always advise to use raw or es for the mux when outputing mp3 audio files) Feel free to change the article. --[[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 17:40, 6 September 2007 (CEST)
