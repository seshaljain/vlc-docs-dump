'''TODO: this wiki page is work in progress'''

== Installation ==

You need to have [[libvlc]] with headers already installed.

TODO: install from CPAN

== Usage ==
<syntaxhighlight lang="perl">
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use 5.010;

use VideoLAN::LibVLC;

unless (@ARGV) {
	die "1 argument needed - path to a file.";
}

my $inst = VideoLAN::LibVLC::Instance->new;
my $media = VideoLAN::LibVLC::Media->new($inst, $ARGV[0], "path");
my $player = VideoLAN::LibVLC::MediaPlayer->new($media);

$player->play;

sleep 5;
say $player->fullscreen;
$player->fullscreen(1);
say $player->fullscreen;
sleep 5;
$player->toggle_fullscreen;
say $player->fullscreen;
sleep 5;
</syntaxhighlight>

== Known issues ==

* Libvlc event handling is not supported currently.
* It's unknown whether it works under windows or not, I never tested it there.
