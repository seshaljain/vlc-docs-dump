Rémi Denis-Courmont, courmisch on git and [[IRC]].

I wrote the [[Unicode]] layer, the new [[RTP]] input, [[TLS]] and [[SRTP]] cryptography plugins, most of the XCB (X11) support, [[MIDI]] plugins, udev integration, the transparent file decompression plugin, ARM NEON assembly optimizations.
I also maintain the core networking and threading code, and am involved with various other parts of VLC.
