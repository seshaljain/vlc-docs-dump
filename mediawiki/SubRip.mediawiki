'''SubRip''' is the native subtitle format of the [http://zuggy.wz.cz/ SubRip program], developed by a friend of the creator of [[SubViewer]]. It is one of the most used formats for [[subtitles]].

It may have the [[file extension]] <code>.srt</code>. It can be embedded in [[Matroska|mkv]] files.

== Specification ==
=== Format ===
Each frame of a subtitle is formatted as follows:
<!--Begin format code-->
 <var>n</var>
 h1:m1:s1,d1 --> h2:m2:s2,d2
 Line 1
 Line 2
 &hellip;
 
<!--End format code-->
Note the last line is a blank line between subtitle frames, and the decimal separator is a comma (per French-style).

;<var>n</var>
:sequential number.  This may also appear on the same line as start/stop times
;<nowiki>h1:m1:s1,d1</nowiki>
:start time of this frame, in hours minutes and seconds to three decimal places
;<nowiki>h2:m2:s2,d2</nowiki>
:stop time

==== Example ====
A 2-frame subtitle:
<!--Begin example code-->
 1
 00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
 a bla bla ble a bla bla ble
 a bla bla ble
 
 2
 00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,800
 a bla bla ble&hellip;
<!--End example code-->

* {{Tag pair|b}}: bold
* {{Tag pair|s}}: strikethrough
* {{Tag pair|u}}: underline
* {{Tag pair|i}}: italic
* <code><nowiki>&lt;font color=&hellip; face=&hellip;&gt;</nowiki></code>: font attributes
