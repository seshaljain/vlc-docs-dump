==Undocumented RPN operators==
[[User:Teyut|Teyut]] 19:38, 15 April 2007 (CEST): I've added informations about some RPN operators using the source code in ''rpn.c''. However, I didn't test them all, and especially, I'm not sure how '''vlc_get_meta''' and '''snapshot''' works, and I have no clue what '''vlm_command''' and '''services_discovery_*''' commands are made for. So if someone can confirm what I've written, and give a better example for '''vlm_command''', it would be better I think.
:Thanks for the help! The descriptions look ok. (except the VLM example which is kind of not using a VLM command, but I'll fix it) [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 21:59, 15 April 2007 (CEST)

==Updated RPN: examples?==
I fixed some wiki formatting on the RPN section, but it really needs an example or two to explain how RPN works, say an example of seeking forward 20 seconds? --[[User:Gth|Gth]] 18:26, 23 April 2012 (CEST)
