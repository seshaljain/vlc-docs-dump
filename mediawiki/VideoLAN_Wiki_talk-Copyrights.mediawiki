What ''is'' the copyright on the stuff here? Is it GPL, GFDL, Creative Commons...? --[[User:H2g2bob|h2g2bob]] 14:50, 20 November 2006 (CET)
: The new documentation section clearly states that all pages in the Documentation namespace ( '''<nowiki>http://wiki.videolan.org/index.php/Documentation:.*</nowiki>''' ) are licensed under the GPL. This is mainly due to the fact that the old documentation which i moved to the wiki was already licensed under the GPL. All other wiki pages don't have clear licensing info that i know of.
