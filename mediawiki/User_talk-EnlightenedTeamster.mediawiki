Hi, Thanks for the help on the documentation. I'd like to keep the Documentation:* pages self contained (anything in the wiki can link to those but I'd rather that they don't link outside Documentation:* pages). Otherwise we'll have problems when/if we ever want to create PDF versions out of the wiki documentation. This rule should especially apply to words/expressions/concepts which are needed to understand the documentation. Links to advanced topics which might be related to a documentation page would be ok, as long as they're not needed to understand the documentation. I'll try to write a small guide line about what should and what shouldn't be put in the Documentation:* pages in case we're lucky to have more people like you helping out :) Regards, [[User:Dionoea|Dionoea]] 02:21, 17 February 2007 (CET)
