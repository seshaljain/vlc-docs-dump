== Audio and Video are out of sync.  ==

<br>If you are transcoding a file, use the audio-sync option. 

<br>You can manually set the audio offset while playing (so you can put the audio back in sync). 

The default keys to increase/decrease the offset are '''Ctrl+K''' and '''Ctrl+L''' in ''Windows'', and '''f''' and '''g''' in ''Mac'' (adjust step is 50ms). 

<br>''Linux/Unix'': Try using another audio output plugin and, under Unix, kill esd or artsd if they are running.

<br> 

If the problem is due to the input file, try to adjust the track with '''Tools &gt; Track Synchronisation'''.<br>
