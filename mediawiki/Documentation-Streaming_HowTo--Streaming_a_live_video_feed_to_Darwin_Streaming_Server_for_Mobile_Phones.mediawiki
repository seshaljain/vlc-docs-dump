==Streaming a live video to DSS for Mobile Phones with VLC==

 {{%}} '''vlc -vvv v4l2:///dev/video0:input=1:width=128:height=96:adev=hw.1,0:samplerate=32000 --sout '#transcode{venc=ffmpeg{keyint=1},vcodec=mp4v,vb=100k,acodec=mp4a,fps=10,ab=8k,channels=1,samplerate=16000}:rtp{mp4a-latm,dst=127.0.0.1,port-audio=20000,port-video=20002,ttl=127,name=CHANNEL,sdp=file:///usr/local/movies/channel.sdp}''''
where:
* '''v4l2:///dev/video0''' is the video device you want you want to stream,
* '''input=1''' is the input channel of the video device (0 - tv tuner, 1 - composite),
* '''width=128:height=96''' is the width and height of the input video signal to fetch by VLC,
* '''adev=hw.1,0''' is the alsa audio device to capture audio from,
* '''samplerate=32000''' is the input sample rate of the audio live feed,
* '''venc=ffmpeg''' is the encoder used (in this case it's ffmpeg, but you can use x264),
* '''{keyint=1}''' is the advanced ffmpeg encoder switches,
* '''vcodec=mp4v''' is video codec used to encode this live video feed (in this case it's MPEG4),
* '''vb=100k''' is the video [[bitrate]] (100 kbits/s is this case),
* '''acodec=mp4a''' is the audio codec used (is this case it's AAC),
* '''fps=10''' is the frame rate of the video feed,
* '''ab=8k''' is the audio bitrate (is this case 8 kbits/s),
* '''mp4a-latm''' is only used for aac audio, it activates a different payload format for aac,
* '''dst=127.0.0.1''' is the destination IP, where Darwin Streaming Server is hosted,
* '''ttl=127''' is the value of the TTL (Time To Live) of your IP packets (which means that the stream will be able to cross 126 routers),
* '''sdp=file:///usr/local/movies/channel.sdp''' is where to create the [[SDP]] file for live streaming with Darwin Streaming Server (it should be inside of the DSS movies folder),
* '''name=CHANNEL''' is the name of the live video feed.

Tested on Nokia N73 and SE K800.


There is a small problem with some Nokia phones and Darwin Streaming Servers, that need a line to be edited in the created SDP file (for example):

* '''from b=RR:0 to b=RR:800'''

After running this command from console, you can access it from your mobile phone or VLC or any player that supports [[RTSP]] protocol

* '''rtsp://192.168.2.3/channel.sdp'''
where
* '''192.168.2.3''' is the IP address of the machine where DSS is running.
