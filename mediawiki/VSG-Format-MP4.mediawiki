== MP4, 3GP or MOV files with no audio ==

If those files have AMR audio (usually ones from mobile phones) they won't work with VLC versions under 2.0.

Follow these steps to fix this issue:<br> 

*Open the URL in QuickTime Player. 
*Let it decide which data rate is best for your connection. 
*Let it play for a few seconds, then pause it. 
*Open the stream info, copy the url. 
*Open &amp; save that one in VLC.<br>
