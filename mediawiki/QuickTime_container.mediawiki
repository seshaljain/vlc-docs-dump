{{Mmwiki|QuickTime container}}
[[QuickTime]] natively uses this container ([https://developer.apple.com/standards/classic-quicktime/ described] as ''QuickTime File Format'' by Apple), which can store other data, including video, audio and text. The advantage of this container format is the separation of data from metadata: writes to metadata do not necessitate a re-write of the entire media file. QuickTime video files have the extension .mov (presumably for movie) or .qt (presumably for QuickTime).

The QuickTime container was made into a standard "ISO base media file format", the basis for [[MPEG-4]] (part 14) and [[3GP]].
