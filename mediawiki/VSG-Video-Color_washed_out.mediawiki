= Video Colors are washed out  =

When using nVidia cards or improper output settings, with {{VLC}} on [[Windows]], sometimes the black levels are not correct, and dark regions in the image appear as gray. The image is washed-out or milky, like in the following screenshots:

= Solution Using the nVidia Control Pannel =

To fix this issue:

*go to the nVidia Control panel&nbsp;
*change color range from ''limited (16-235)'' to ''full dynamic range (0-255)''&nbsp;
*restart VLC

Some versions of the nVidia Control Pannel do not present this setting. You can also try to "Reset to defaults" from the upper right corner. 


= Alternate Solutions  =

* Tools -> Settings -> Video and try the following, in the order of decreasing playback performance:
* Switch to DirectX(DirectDraw) - recommended setting for Windows XP, incompatible with Vista Aero interface
* If that does not work, Disable Hardware YUV->RGB conversions
* If that does not work, try Windows GDI video output (worst performance)

After each change you need to restart the player (not just the playback).
