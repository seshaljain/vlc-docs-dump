==Poor Quality or Strange Video==

'''What are the problems with the playback?'''

Some video formats are incompatible with some versions of VLC.

From here on out, we will assume the file which VLC cannot play back is supported by your version of VLC.

{{VSGEntry|Visual errors|VSG:Video:VisualErrors|Video output is '''black''', '''white''' or '''garbled'''; or you see '''green''', '''blue''', or '''red lines''' on your video.}}
