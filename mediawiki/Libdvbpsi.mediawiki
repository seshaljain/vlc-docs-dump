The libdvbpsi is part of the VideoLAN project.

The libdvbpsi is a [[library]] so it can also be used with extra programs that need [[DVB]] and PSI decoders and generators.

libdvbpsi makes [[VLC media player]] or other projects capable of [[demultiplex]]ing a satellite DVB stream. The library aims at making it easy to decode PSI tables (such as PAT, PMT etc.) present in a TS/DVB stream.
