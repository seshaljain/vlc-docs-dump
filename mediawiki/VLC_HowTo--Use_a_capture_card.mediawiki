----

=== The following describes how to watch TV with your DVB-Card ===
(tested with DVB-T and the Windows-Version of VLC)

* find out the frequencies of your location
* go to File/Open CaptureCard
* choose DVB DirectShow
* check your kind of card (DVB-S -C -T)
* choose first frequency and bandwidth
* click on play

If your stream has "multiple" (for instance multiple sub channels, or you want to programmatically select a particular audio stream):

* when the channel plays, select playlist
* rightclick on the item, which is playing and select information
* go to stream
* here you can find all broadcast-channels with their service-ID
* write them down
* go to File/Open CaptureCard
* in the option-line at the bottom append a space (if not there) a : and the keyword "program=", followed by one of the service-IDs
* it should look like: ...300ms :program=16214
* click on play
* that's your channel
* now you can rename this playing item of the playlist to your station-name
* and the same with the next service-ID
* and so on with the next frequency

'''Don't forget to save your playlist!'''

Have fun!

The minimal command to transcode from a capture card to 
a portable MPEG file (this example includes trancoding which may be lessly, be careful) is thus:
 vlc v4l:// :v4l-norm=1: '--sout=#transcode{vcodec=mp1v,vb=2030,audio-sync,acodec=mpga,ab=192,channels=2}:std{access=file,mux=mpeg1,url="out_file.mpg"}'

These MPEG files have been verified to work with:

* Windows Media Player 10
* Apple QuickTime Player 7
* XINE 1.0
* ffplay
* xanim 2.80 (no audio)
